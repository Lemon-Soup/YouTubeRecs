#NAME?,2023-07-24T16:00:03Z,Entertainment,"""I actually don't know if I even owned a Barbie."" Margot Robbie may have not been obsessed with the dolls as a child, but there was one thing that she was extremely keen on: the Barbie Dreamhouse. From constructing her fold-out house as a 5-year-old to seeing a life-size version come to life right before her eyes, Margot Robbie truly manifested her Barbie dreams. Margot breaks down her entire process for the 'Barbie' movie, from the mental preparation for the role, working alongside Greta Gerwig and Ryan Gosling on set, the fabulous pink wardrobe and so much more.

The UK government is seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016.

It wants messaging services to clear security features with the Home Office before releasing them to customers.

The act lets the Home Office demand security features are disabled, without telling the public. Under the update, this would have to be immediate.

Sugar is one of the strongest ""drugs‚Äù and can get consumers really hooked. Food giants know this only too well. That‚Äôs why they use sugar, fats and flavor enhancers to encourage people to buy their products and boost their profits. The result: more and more people around the world are overweight or obese. Illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are becoming more prevalent. What can be done to change or even put a stop to the food industry‚Äôs strategies?

If you were asked to picture London during the Middle Ages, you might think of The White Tower, Westminster Abbey or Guildhall - some of the capital‚Äôs most famous landmarks. But scratch beneath the surface and you‚Äôll find there are lots more clues to this medieval metropolis.

In the second episode of 'Hidden London', London tour guide Katie Wignall seeks out the London of the Middle Ages - a city of narrow streets and soaring spires, almost completely destroyed by the Great Fire of 1666‚Ä¶ and the Blitz during the Second World War. But despite the devastation and centuries of development, not all of that city is lost. 

Katie start her tour at the London Charterhouse, which has been home to many significant moments in London's history since 1371. It has been a monastery, grand mansion, boys school and an almshouse, which it remains to this day. More recently, Charterhouse square was dug up as part of London's cross rail construction and a mass burial dating back to the Black Death in the 14th Century was discovered. 

Next, Katie visits part of the Roman Wall which used to surround the old city. She then touches upon the history of London Bridge which has undergone reconstruction twice in the few centuries and looks very different from the heavily built upon medieval bridge - home to some of the wealthiest citizens at the time. 

After passing several significant medieval palaces, rivers, churches, stones and clinks, Katie arrives at her final destination - St John's Priory. Headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller, the monks who lived there in the Middle Ages took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and were expected to fight on crusade in the Holy Land if called upon.

Today I‚Äôm flying the world‚Äôs best First Class, Etihad The Residence. In fact it‚Äôs a class beyond First Class, and consists of a three room suite on the Airbus A380. I‚Äôm on the very first flight back on The Residence after a three year break, and given the previous cost of over $20,000 I‚Äôm keen to find out what‚Äôs changed now this is being offered as a paid upgrade from their First Class Apartments. As always I‚Äôll give you a full walkthrough of the entire experience, from the private lounge offered at London Heathrow, to the upstairs of the A380, the dining &amp; of course what it‚Äôs like in my own private ensuite bedroom! As usual I paid full price myself, full costings shown in the video.

ZEbCz7B2-Eg,2022-08-13T18:08:19Z,People & Blogs,"hello friends (‚ïØ‚ñΩ‚ï∞ )
i welcome you to another study session! let's be productive together for a few hours :))
u can read a lil study guide below!~~üåü

i filmed these during my finals season! i hope you enjoy them &amp; can have a productive time here, and most importantly, enjoy the shots of ollie peacefully sleeping.
i tried to lower the volume of the loud sounds (i get in the zone and forget to be more careful handling materials) and cut around camera noises, however because of the length of the video, i always miss some and it makes me want to delete the video, never post it! but i'm curbing my perfectionism this year ‚â°(‚ñîÔπè‚ñî)‚â° &amp; i promised a no music swm to viewers, so here it is. next one will be better, pinky promise. most of all, i just hope these can be a wonderful companion to those feeling less inspired to keep going.
i hope you have a wonderful weekend/week ahead of u ü•∫ best of luck with all your studies!!~‚≠ê i hope you're healthy and strong. a big big hug xx
lots of love,
maria
üíóüêª

‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü how it works: ‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü
there are four study sessions, 50 mins each, with three 10 min breaks included.
focus as best as you can during your study session because we'll be resting in just a bit. it will get easier the more you do it, as your brain can be trained to focus for longer periods of time as you study consistently, so don't give up! you can do this :-) 
aditionally, because this is a no music SWM, if you feel like it, you can always add your own playlists in the background or lofi streams, for example.

‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü at the beginning of the study sessions, make sure to:
- turn off anything you're not going to be using to study
- have your materials ready to go
- have drinks/food ready so you don't have to get up to go get necessities
- have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish during the session (i.e., choose a task from your to-do list)

‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü during the breaks:
- stop working as soon as the timer hits, even if you're mid-sentence
- make sure to get up, do some simple stretches
- refill anything that needs to get refilled
- talk to friends/update family

‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü at the end of this video:
if you want to continue studying, give yourself a longer break and you can repeat this video!

you're set to go! ‚ô°

(Íàç·¥óÍàç) stay cozy!

Hello everyone.
I'm glad you watched this channelüçë
Please turn on the subtitles to view.

These days, I'm doing my best even though I'm not getting enough sleep on weekdays ...
I want to spend the weekend relaxing.üåø
This time, I bought loungewear at SHEIN, so I will introduce it.
At IKEA, we buy fake greens and so on.
The room became cute all at once.üõãÔ∏è

I take pictures of casual daily life and cooking.
I would be happy if you could take it easy ~~

So many possibilities now that I have my PC ü•π‚ú® I can basically draw in a big Photoshop canvas with even thousands of layers üòÇ and play games with high graphics ‚ú®
I‚Äôm happy with how it turned out as I basically have limited knowledge about anything PC hardwares, tech related stuff üòñ I couldn‚Äôt be more relieved that I somehow managed to make it worküòå

I have some plans to change the motherboard, AIO cooler and case fans and probably add some figures or two inside soon~ and when that‚Äôs finished I can probably do a new desk tour video?

i built my first pc! üéâ

i‚Äôm so excited to finally have my own gaming + streaming pc, and what a process it was learning about it all! from figuring out what each part does, to which ones to get, to how to assemble it all. but, i‚Äôm glad i pulled through and now have a pc that i truly love (and of course i had to add studio ghibli vibes to it)!

as somebody who had no prior experience, i‚Äôm hoping that by posting this video that other people new to the pc world can watch this and be encouraged to be able to build one too! if you‚Äôre interested in the parts used, be sure to check out the list below.

This was truly a learning experience for me as I had no prior knowledge of building a pc and what the individual parts do. From doing a lot of research and watching YouTube tutorials I have a better understanding of what each part does and what role they play.

Welcome to Bilbo Baggins's cozy hobbit hole build in Sims 4! 
As a Lord of the Rings fan, building a hobbit hole was a must-do on my list. This unique take on the classic hobbit home actually takes inspiration from the acorn shape, half-buried in the ground, with massive tree growing on top of the roof, making it fully secluded hideaway. 
As usual, I kept the exterior simple yet charming, and covered the roof with all kinds of bushes that help it blend into the surroundings seamlessly.
Enjoy the video and thank you for watching!

Everything is No CC and contains No CC Paintings. You can find more information about it in the description below.

This home is a rental lot in Granite Falls. This means that your Sims can vacation there. I created the design with the help of an AI. I used it to create an inspiration picture and built my own version from it. But this only affects the exterior. The interior is my own creation.

You will find the houses there under the category ""Tray Files"" if you scroll down.

I use the Tool Mod from Twisted Mexi for my Sims 4 builds! You will find hints in the video, in addition, the video says which Tool Mod values I have used. Unfortunately, this mod can only be used on the PC. BUT to download my houses, you must NOT have installed the mod. All objects are downloaded in the same position as you can see in the video. This means that Pc AND console players can use my houses. You only need the same packs of game that I used.

In case console players also want to use rotated objects: I'll provide you with new rooms in The Sims 4 gallery from time to time, where you can find rotated and resized objects. With the help of these rooms console players have more possibilities in The Sims 4 build mode!

When you download both floors, try saving each room to your library and placing them individually on the apartment like a puzzle. You can refer to the floorplans you downloaded. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvience. We have yet to have an update where we can download and upload apartments with platforms.

finally i‚Äôm back with an aesthetic room makeover video. i‚Äôve been wanting to give my room a makeover for a long time, and decided that it is the time to make it finally happen! also a lot of you guys were asking me for more room content, so i hope you all like this video :) i am very satisfied with this korean style, aesthetic and minimalist look. i honestly took a lot of inspiration from pinterest, and am very happy that it turned out like how i imagined. even though my room is very much small, i think the new furniture and style made my room way more spacious. thank you for being a part of my room makeover, love you all! 
enjoy the video üíñ

I used lots of natural tones and blues. It's a very big apartment with 4 bedrooms, 2 living rooms and an amazing balcony overlooking the bay. I hope you love this one as much as I do :) xx

These Christmas thrift flips are awesome! I've picked out some items you can usually find at Goodwill and I've turned them into high end Christmas decorations. So don't waste your money on expensive Christmas decorations this year. In this time of high inflation, I have just what you need with these thrifted finds totally transformed into beautiful Christmas decor.

After visiting another Michael's location, you will see that they added many new items to their fall collections with beautiful colourful pumpkins and their fall stems were beyond amazing...so many choices and decorating ideas! 

I saw a few new gorgeous wreaths, multiple stems and picks from pumpkins, acorns and floral and the addition of stunning serve ware with beautiful fall designs for your gatherings.

So many great ideas, I was so inspired and ready to decorate for fall but not quite! ;) I'm waiting patiently for Michael's fall sale to pick up a few tings to add to my growing fall decor collection.

I hope you got some motivation and great ideas today on what's new at Michael's for 2023 fall season for your home.

Hello and welcome if you're new and please consider subscribing, give me a thumbs up and share with your friends...I would love it if you would join my YouTube family.

Thank you for watching and hope you enjoy!

After I return my finds to the shelves for you to buy, see which piece ends up in the checkout line as I'm about to leave the store. The piece is in the thumbnail photo for this video. Can you guess which bargain someone bought?

Also, watch me find Italian hand painted #plates and lusterware and transferware pieces. Plus, see the piece that stumped me. You all probably got it, but I didn't get the joke!

The Goodwill outlet is one of my favorite places to find home decor on a budget. If you are trying to decorate your home and don‚Äôt want to break the bank, I love how far you can stretch your dollar at the Goodwill outlet.

Another thing I love about it is that something from Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, or West Elm is not going to cost any more than an item laying right next to it from the dollar store.

If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly ""comedy"" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

If you want to know HOW I make my videos including gear, lighting, all the tiddly bits that connect it all together, (with cheaper alternatives and kit I used to use), I've listed each item, what it's great at, and why I use it on the gear section of my website here:

Blueberry jam / compote. 
(You can also ad a tea spoon of chia seeds to further thicken it up) Squish 2 cups of blueberries and place in a small pan. Cook on low heat until the blueberries reduce and thicken. Add some sugar and lemon juice to taste. I used the whole lemon and 1,5 tbs of sugar.

Plus, watch me uncover an Avon bottle, a milk #glass bud vase and a 1940s-50s lipstick and powder dish while I'm #shopping. 

I shopped for ceramics too including stoneware pieces, Japanese bouillon cups and English teacups. Watch and don't miss my list of English ceramics that you need to find during your next haul or attic cleanout. I also discovered a 1960s solid hardwood rocking chair for under $20 and a Victorian side chair for under $15. I left these two chairs for you to buy and flip for much more. You won't believe the deals I left for you to find in these two chairs alone.

Follow along as we share daily life of starting seeds and planting seedlings for the cutting garden, establish new landscaping near our home to try to give it that early look and feel.

Hello everyone, my name is Julie and on Thrilled Thrifter you will find that I absolutely love thrift shopping.(Especially for home decor!) I want to share all things thrift here on my channel to teach you how to go thrifting for your home, family and friends. {I'm not a reseller!}  I mostly thrift at Goodwill, yard/garage sales, FB marketplace, antique stores, estate sales and so many other local thrift stores. I believe you can make your home beautiful on a thrifty budget! I will take you on so many thrift with me shopping trips, share my thrift hauls and almost always show you how to use thrift finds in your home. I post every Friday and sometimes on Tuesday.

I found MAYBE MY BEST EVER (!!!) thrifted item (lmk how it compares to your best thrift finds!), that showcases the unique one of a kind pieces you can find here in Miami.

My name is Dre and I am a part-time reseller on Depop and Poshmark. When I am not thrifting you can catch me dancing on sidelines as an NFL Cheerleader! 

I absolutely LOVE vintage clothes, encouraging cyclical fashion, and translating my dance + music creativity to pieces I find. ‚ó°Ãà

My name is Laura and I am a full time vintage shop owner and I've been self employed for 10 years selling my vintage finds online, in flea markets and local vintage malls. I love to resell 2nd hand and vintage items so they can live a second (or third or fourth) life! 

I've got new design makeover episodes in the works, so make sure to subscribe so you don't miss when I drop a new episode =)

Cheers!

The Blessing Barn in Mendon, MA is a real gem. If you are in the New England area, it‚Äôs worth the trip to visit!

I'm so glad that you can join me today for this thrifting adventure as I wanted to introduce and share a video like this for some time.

When I go thrifting I'm usually looking for vintage and antique decor items to decorate my home.  I love the thrill of the hunt and also appreciate that these pieces can be economical and certainly unique.

You will find a few vintage pieces in today's video and the artwork was amazing, I wanted to take many home with me! Please stay to the end as I share an awesome small thrift haul.

So let me know if I missed something that I should have taken home and have you found a unique decor item that you're still obsessing about? Would love to hear back from you. :)

Please consider subscribing if you like this type of content as I'm slowly curating my home with these types of decor finds.

Thank you for watching.  Enjoy!
xoxo Diana

Hi! My name is Johanna. Welcome to my channel and my dream home! In this video I will share with you the process of bringing back to life an abandoned place and house that belong to my family, renovating the stove and a room of my new home, decorating it and transforming it in a cottage fit for a fairy. 

This channel is about house restoring and decorating, gardening, cooking and growing one's food, rural life or countryside life in a small village, crafting useful and beautiful things that make life in the countryside easier and more enjoyable. Join me on my everyday life adventures as countryside life besides being peaceful and beautiful, can be a real challenge sometimes!

If you've enjoyed watching the first video I've uploaded here, please do subscribe and share it with a dear friend. A big thank you to all of you that will help my new channel reach more people! Happy Holidays to all of you!

I've NEVER found this particular model in the wild... and its worth OVER $200 on Ebay!  Let's go thrifting and find out what it was!
Hello Everyone! Its Tiffany with Thrifting Vegas. I shop at thrift stores, estate sales, garage sales and discount stores for items I can resell for a profit on online platforms like eBay, Poshmark and Offer-Up.

GOODWILL FIND WORTH $200 on EBAY! / Cant Believe I FOUND BOTH PARTS! / BUY My HAUL / Thrifting Vegas

Its Wednesday morning and all ready over 100 degrees here in Las Vegas. I'm here bright and early hoping that my favorite Goodwill has restocked for 40% off senior day. I have my reuseable shopping bags and Thrifting Vegas blanket, and I'm so excited to find treasures in almost every aisle!!! Thrift with me and learn what to bolo and what to leave on the shelf, and why.  Stay to watch my haul where I show you everything I found, what I paid and what I expect to get for it. Please don't forget that you can BUY DIRECTLY from my HAUL. Sometimes I find something I absolutely love, but almost all of the items you see in my haul are for sale.  Please don't wait, I get hundreds of emails a day! If you would like to purchase something, please send me your offer (plus shipping to your zip code) in an email with your mailing address, Paypal email, and a description, timestamp or screenshot of the item you would like to purchase, to ThriftingVegas.Tiffany@gmail.com. 

After the haul, stay to watch my BONUS FOOTAGE of my new 6' Buddy the Elf, our cats, Ziggy and Bandit on Hummingbird Watch, and the beautiful hummingbirds in our yard. Our German Shepherd dogs, Bear and Rio, have their own channel, so please subscribe @bearandriolasvegas to enjoy their latest adventures.  If you haven't had a chance to watch my new You Tube Shorts, please check out my HOW TO... playlist below!  I release a Short every Tuesday! Now, join me, Tiffany, at Thrifting Vegas and... Let's Go thrifting!

Please LIKE, SUBSCRIBE and HIT THE BELL to get a notification when I upload a new video!

This video is so late. I got super busy and did not have time to finish editing it. Our power went out the day I had set aside to work on it, so it had to wait. 

I am so proud of how well this dress came together. It is incredibly beautiful, and I love it to the moon and back. Its romantic, long and flowy, comfortable, no fuss, and all around perfect. I was working on a knit shawl to match this dress, but, ahem, problems arose. 

If you have any questions about the construction of this dress, feel free to ask! 
Also, I did go to the eye dr, and I have a diagnosis, and I've been on meds since 6/29...because that's how delayed this video is. Which I do feel bad about. My 40th was last week, and it was just crazy busy. 

The bodice pattern I used was: McCalls M7654  https://simplicity.com/mccalls/pdm7654
I also used 1/4"" elastic.

Do you want to help young adults aging out of foster care? Contact your local foster care agencies and let them know you'd like to help. If you are in Arizona, I recommend contacting Arizona Children's Association to find out how you can help.

Fractal animation made with Mandelbulb3D.

In today's video I'm excited to share with you Michael's New Fall Decor 2023! 

Yes I know it's super early but I wanted to give you a sneak peak at some of the beautiful brand new fall collection at Michael's so that you can get a few decorating ideas and of course shop before it flies off the shelves.

What you'll see today shows a large variety of new colour options to set the fall mood if you like fall neutrals to the dark moody trends like shades of blue and burgundy.  Michael's Fall collection contains beautiful wreaths, stems, garlands, containers and fall wall art to suite everyone, I loved everything! Please leave me a comment on what was your favourite item(s ) and colour collection?

Please consider subscribing and sharing with your friends, I would love for you to join my YouTube family!  I will be sharing more ideas and decorating in the next few months for my Fall Decorate with me!

Thank you for watching! Enjoy! xoxo Diana

I update a 1990‚Äôs country floor lamp, wicker suitcase from Mexico, and wooden canister set; turn an old desk drawer and thrifted metal legs into a unique side table, turn another old desk drawer into wall storage; create framed art with thrifted frames, notecards, wallpaper samples, and needlepoint. I repurpose an old clock frame and a trashed pedestal table base. I use a toy buggy as a succulent planter, turn a ceramic bird votive candle holder into an adorable pin cushion, and much more! I hope this video provides you with lots of creative inspiration.

Product mentioned in video:
Wood Stain Markers - https://amzn.to/46UAMKb


The Goodwill outlet is one of my favorite places to find home decor on a budget. If you are trying to decorate your home and don‚Äôt want to break the bank, I love how far you can stretch your dollar at the Goodwill outlet.

Another thing I love about it is that something from Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, or West Elm is not going to cost any more than an item laying right next to it from the dollar store.

I love to use a combination of items from Dollar Tree, Hobby Lobby, JoAnns, and other craft stores. But if I can think of an alternative that is at Dollar Tree I always try to let you know, even if that isn't what I use. I prefer to use items from all stores that bring you inspiration so you can make items according to your creativity. In creativity, there is NO WRONG!!! Have an amazing day.

THANK YOU to all of my channel members. I know I'm supposed to add this at the end of the video but I forgot and the video took like 10 hours to upload and I just now remembered and like, even though you all mean a lot to me and even though I rarely post videos y'all still seem to waste your money for those silly paint brush chat/comment badges and toasty emojis (k not gonna lie those are kinda cool)... but I'm not going to sit here another 10 hours just to see your names scroll across the screen for like 5 seconds. For real, it takes me like 30 minutes to make it do that. I'm slow. I know most of you skip through the video to the end just to see that part anyhow so I think this long run-on sentence will suffice, even though you probably skimmed through this too.

DIY AGED POTTERY TECHNIQUES | RH, POTTERY BARN VESSEL DUPES | THRIFT FLIPS | FAUX ANTIQUES

Hi sweet friends!!! Today I'm sharing 4 techniques for achieving the aged, antique vessel effect. Instead of the high priced RH, Pottery Barn vessels, we're make inexpensive dupes with thrifted, dollar tree and old decor pieces!!! These faux antiques are easy and so much fun to create. 

If you haven't already, I hope you'll consider SUBSCRIBING. Before you go please say Hi, Like and Share!!! Also let me know if you plan to try one of these techniques for yourself. Thanks for your support, it means the world to me!! Have a wonderful rest of your day. Take care friends, and God bless.

DIY MARATHON ALERT!  For this week's video I decided to compile some of my favorite DIYs that I created for essentially FREE! Sure, some supplies are required but most of it is about bringing the outside, in, OR grabbing things out of your recycle bin to make some aesthetic home decor! I know for me, the winter months in home decor can pose a challenge because everything feels so empty after taking down all of the holiday decor. But budgets might also be a little tighter due to the holiday festivities so I thought what better time to post some DECORATE FOR FREE or TRASH TO TREASURE content. If nothing else, I hope you found at least one DIY you will try and if you do, please share with me over on Instagram.  Thank you all for your amazing support and positivity!

gbZi11qNULY,2022-04-29T17:00:43Z,Howto & Style,"Restoration Hardware has stunning decor...at prices that can stun you!  So why not dupe them for a fraction of the cost?  And all of the satisfaction of a DIY project!

The RH Indonesian Currency Disk is a gorgeous large piece and it's simple design is perfect for a dupe project.  In this video I start with foam board from the Dollar Tree, add a some drywall mud, paint and a whole lot of time and I end up with a large, inexpensive, high end dup.

D√©cor trends change all the time.  How we use our spaces changes too.  And I agree, there are items that should be splurged on to make sure you get quality and longevity.  This is why it's such a great idea to save on d√©cor pieces with dupes and DIYs.  Save money in one area to spend it somewhere else.

This d√©cor piece is part of my dining room project.  I know in the future, I'm completely redecorating the dining room; new furniture, wall trim, new art, the works.  But for now, I want it to at least look presentable.  So instead of splurging, I'm saving, duping and DIYing!

This is not as hard as it looks.  This luscious coat started as a thrifted dress and was embellished with pieces from a vintage blanket, and patches made from blazers and a skirt.  We will also do some creative cutting and sewing to make flared cuff sleeves and pockets.  Even the button closure is upcycled (no button hole making...yay!).  I'm sure you will find this a very rewarding project whether you make this for yourself or you upcycle fashion to sell.

I am naming it the basic cushion, because you only need to cut one piece of fabric to make it. And here's how you can make your own.

I‚Äôm Whitney from http://WhiskeyandWhit.com, a budget-friendly DIYer who will show you how to create some amazing Dollar Tree DIYs for Fall 2023. Fall has arrived at Dollar Tree so I'm kicking off my Fall Decor DIYs 2023 with a ton of Dollar Store DIY inspiration! It may be early for Fall DIYs, but if you sleep on the Fall DIY supplies at Dollar Tree, they will be gone by the time you want them. So save these Fall Dollar Tree DIYs for when you're ready for Fall decor ideas! I also love to share Budget Home Decor content, Cricut tips and tricks, and Dollar Tree Hacks, so consider following along on all my platforms below.  #WhiskeyandWhit #DollarTreeDIY #dollartreefall #dollartreefalldecor

Yc3NK3jozCo,2023-07-28T23:00:09Z,Howto & Style,"Come along as I take you shopping at the Goodwill outlet (a.k.a. the Goodwill bins) in search for home decor.

The Goodwill outlet is one of my favorite places to find home decor on a budget. If you are trying to decorate your home and don‚Äôt want to break the bank, I love how far you can stretch your dollar at the Goodwill outlet.

Another thing I love about it is that something from Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, or West Elm is not going to cost any more than an item laying right next to it from the dollar store.

XaWAyQwWIdw,2023-06-18T20:22:42Z,Entertainment,"I am cleaning this kitchen for free for a family who lost their mom/wife in a tragic accident last year. They have been grieving her death and have had a hard time staying on top of cleaning the house. A neighbor/friend contacted me to let me know of this situation and wondered if I could help. I, of course, was thrilled at the idea of helping out this family. They didn't want a lot of help, but did agree to let me at least clean the kitchen. My heart hurts for their loss. I wish I could do more, but hope having a clean kitchen has at least lifted their spirits somewhat. I'm grateful they let me come in and help because I know it was hard for them to allow someone to do this for them.

i7-8DiVdvVY,2023-07-23T06:17:29Z,People & Blogs,"The charming French countryside kitchen is a place where time seems to stand still, and memories of generations past come to life. As you step into this rustic sanctuary, you are immediately transported to a bygone era filled with warmth, simplicity, and the aroma of delicious home-cooked meals.
The kitchen's design reflects the traditional French farmhouse style, boasting wooden windows and doors , stone fireplace , and a sturdy oak cabinet that has witnessed countless gatherings of family and friends. The aged brass pots and antique utensils hanging on the walls add to the kitchen's timeless charm, evoking a sense of nostalgia that tugs at the heartstrings.
The heart of this kitchen is the aged hearth, where a crackling fire dances and warms the room during chilly evenings. It is not only a source of heat but also a symbol of comfort and togetherness. Generations of families have gathered around this hearth, sharing stories, laughter, and love while preparing hearty meals.
The kitchen shelves are lined with jars of homemade preserves, pickles, and jams, each containing a tale of seasonal abundance and resourcefulness. Memories of sunny summer afternoons spent picking fresh berries in the nearby fields and preparing the preserves together flood the mind.
A vintage kettle hangs above the stove, a treasured possession passed down through the family. Its patina tells a story of many teas lovingly prepared, and the delicious aromas that have filled the kitchen over the years.
The large farmhouse sink, chipped and weathered, holds memories of countless dishes washed and shared, with hands intertwined as the sun sets on another day in the French countryside. It's a symbol of the simple joys of daily life and the importance of gathering around the table to savor the fruits of labor.
The kitchen table  has witnessed the celebrations of birthdays, anniversaries, and the bittersweet farewells of loved ones. The ancient chandelier tells a story, making it a treasure trove of memories.
The aromas that emanate from the oven are nothing short of tantalizing. Hearty stews, golden-brown bread, and delicate pastries are a testament to the culinary heritage that has been lovingly preserved and passed down through generations. The recipes, often cherished family secrets, are carefully handed down, ensuring that the soul of the French countryside lives on in every bite.
As you sit at the kitchen table, surrounded by the Knick-knacks and dried flowers and herbs, you can't help but be filled with a profound sense of belonging. This kitchen is more than just a room; it's a sanctuary of memories that tie together the past, present, and future. It's a place where generations come together, where stories are shared, and where the heart of the French countryside beats.
In this charming French countryside kitchen, time may continue to pass, but the memories it holds are timeless and eternal. It's a place where the past is honored, the present is celebrated, and the future is embraced with open arms. And as you bid farewell to this picturesque haven, the memories made here will forever linger in your heart, reminding you that the essence of life lies in the simple joys of a shared meal and the love of family and friends.",,i7-8DiVdvVY,5,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i7-8DiVdvVY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLBovAYHEbojvFjkosXwaMMNPEqlKw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7-8DiVdvVY,Remember grandma‚Äôs kitchen?

üêùü¶ãüå∫FAVORITE GARDENING BOOKS üå∫ü¶ãüêù

Some of my favorite books are older classics...I have been passionate (obsessed?)  about gardening my entire adult life and have created and left behind a few beautiful gardens.  My gardening style has evolved (matured?) ...I started out with a very classic garden style with a huge focus on specific color schemes and more formal design elements...and now I love a more casual, naturalistic, anything goes, low maintenance garden style.  The only thing I miss is not having quite enough sun for a huge veggie garden like I have alway had...but manage to squeeze in some herbs, greens and tomatoes right in with the flowers.  

üå∫How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back by Ruth Stout. An out of print CLASSIC.  One of my all time FAVORITE gardening books.  The Hardcover is a crazy expensive collectors item, but it is available in soft cover at a good price

In our plan, the left side of the screen is the North side and therefore where we place the taller sunflowers. Remember you may need to adjust the plan depending on orientation of your garden bed!

You will need:
-one packet sunflower seeds (or more if doing multiple varieties)
-one packet cosmo seeds (or more if doing multiple varieties)
-10 dahlia tubers
-one packet zinnia seeds (or more if doing multiple varieties)
-four garden mums for cutting (we like those from bluestone perennials) or can substitute nasturtium, calendula, marigold.

r5hDuPjOPFQ,2022-05-21T15:00:36Z,People & Blogs,"A well-designed garden creates interest from early spring to late autumn, and beyond if you also select plants for the winter structure. But, for the main growing season, much of this interest comes from flowering and foliage plants. Gardeners who want a low-maintenance landscape should look for perennials that are easy to grow and offer a long flowering period. Most perennials flower for two to four weeks, but longer flowering perennials, such as echinacea and catnip, measure their flowering period in months, not weeks.

WHY DO I CALL MY FANS GREG?
Greg is the strongest family on the internet, we're the fastest growing channel on Youtube, and we make fire content. So, instead of making up some pun using my name and calling my fans that, I decided to use a different name entirely. A name so strong, haters tremble when it is spoken. WE ARE GREG.

About Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Oondha Chashma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story evolves around happenings in """"Gokuldham Co-operative Society"""" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around Jethalal (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Tarak Mehta (Sailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. Jethalal finds a friend and philosopher in Tarak Mehta and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalal's family includes his simpleton wife Daya Ben (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son Tapu (Bhavya Gandhi). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members residing in the Gokuldham Society. They have often warned Jethalal to reform Tapu or else be prepared to leave the premises.

1.  Reusing last year's fall decor in new ways.
2.  Paint pumpkins you already have to give them a new look.
3.  Looking at all of last year's fall decorations and then only buying a few new items to go with last year's items.

I hope you are inspired!  So let's save money on fall decor and make 2 fall table centerpieces.

MGV04iqhSuQ,2023-07-29T19:43:29Z,Entertainment,"Elon Musk pairs up with Mel Gibson to expose Hollywood's creepy secrets &amp; support ""Sound of Freedom""

We have all heard of the film Sound of Freedom. It is said to be a film that exposes one of Hollywood‚Äôs deepest secrets, which is child trafficking. However, contrary to what people would expect, few Hollywood stars promote it. In fact, most of them have been silent about the film, leading to a lot of suspicion. How is it that most of the so-called ""philanthropists"" are not saying anything about it? So far, the one person who has been very vocal about the film is Mel Gibson. And now, most recently, Elon Musk seems to have joined him in promoting the film.
But what has Elon Musk done to support Sound of Freedom and expose one of Hollywood‚Äôs creepy secrets? Let‚Äôs find out, shall we? But before we continue, make sure you smash that like button and subscribe to our channel for more amazing celebrity gossip.

It's late July on the flower farm and we finally have started to get our summer flowers.  The first of the sunflowers are blooming, cosmos are starting up, and it won't be long till we have zinnias again too.  The lisianthus is short but beautiful.  The perennial flowers, like phlox, are still saving our butts.  And the oriental lilies are filling the air with their sweet scent.  Join us for a walk through the garden and an update on how things have been growing so far.

Oprah's leadership program for females in South Africa has gotten her involved in yet another controversy. Despite having admirable goals, this institution has come under fire. The opulent nature of the school and its apparent contrast with the adjacent underprivileged areas have sparked criticism and discussion. But more than just the wealth has been a cause for concern. Let's contrast the Academy with the dark underbelly of illegal human trafficking, where innocent victims are lured into evil rings under the pretense of chances and promises, as seen in the film Sound of Freedom. 

Allegations of inappropriate behavior and a climate of violence and intimidation among students have plagued the Academy. People in positions of authority frequently prey on lesser individuals as their victims. His portrayals of Max Rocketansky in the Mad Max trilogy, Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon films, and William Wallace in the historical epic Braveheart‚Äîwhich he both directed and produced‚Äîare some of his most illustrious acting performances. He won two Academy Awards in 1995 for best director and best picture for Braveheart.

Isaac Kappy tried to warn us about the sound of freedom. Isaac Kappy's warnings about the alleged corruption and abuse within Hollywood can be seen in a new light when viewed in the context of Sound of Freedom. The movie, which has been both praised and criticized, brings attention to the issue of the illegal trading of children, a topic that Kappy was vocal about. Isaac gained significant attention for his accusations against several Hollywood elites. He made serious allegations of underage predatory actions against a number of high profile figures in the entertainment industry, including actor Tom Hanks.

According to Ballard, Gibson was deeply involved in the final edit of his movie Sound of Freedom, which tells the story of Ballard's efforts to combat the illegal trading of minors. While Gibson has not directly accused any individuals in Hollywood, his support for Our and his involvement in Sound of Freedom have been interpreted by some as an effort to raise awareness about illegal trade. This aligns with the narrative put forth by Isaac Kappy and others who claim that Hollywood elites are involved in such activities.","['elon musk', 'elon musk news', 'tiktok', 'sound of freedom', 'mel gibson', 'mel gibson sound of freedom', 'elon musk sound of freedom', 'celebrity news', 'hollywood news', 'jamie foxx update', 'jason aldean', 'jim caviezel', 'hollywood elites', 'tmz', 'denzel washington', 'drama bay', 'ice cube', 'jamie foxx', 'dave chapelle', 'Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson', 'hollywood dark secrets', 'fox news', 'david nino rodriguez', 'elon musk x', 'elon musk twitter', 'twitter']",z6I5KygC0Pg,4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z6I5KygC0Pg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLDVfJR7K-BJBktb1F-CUN1DaG5_pw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6I5KygC0Pg,He Tried To Warn Us About Hollywood Elites...,Viral Vision,484,49525,MGV04iqhSuQ,30/07/2023 16:46,"['Hair', 'Head', 'Glasses', 'Hairstyle', 'Facial expression', 'Goggles', 'Sunglasses', 'Smile', 'Vision care', 'Jaw']","['STL', 'IU', '""', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'AFTER', 'YOUR', 'KIDS', '!', '""']",50,51,55,2,2,4,2,1,0

The Wall Street Journal reports that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was blackmailing Bill Gates due to an affair he‚Äôd had with a Russian bridge player. Gates has said many times that he only met Epstein a few times but every time he says that, a new connection between the two men is revealed. They met dozens of times, shared several meals together, flew together on Epstein‚Äôs private jet, met together in France and shared most of the day together in September 2014 with other billionaires Epstein represented to many people that he had been working on behalf of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. This new revelation about an affair smells‚Ä¶.off. Is it a way for Gates to excuse away this familiar relationship? As in, ‚ÄúI had to hang out with him, he was blackmailing me.‚Äù Gates‚Äô spokesperson told the WSJ that this was one of Epstein‚Äôs ploys because he had ‚Äúfailed repeatedly to draw Mr. Gates beyond these matters.‚Äù That also stinks. It implies that Gates knew more than he‚Äôs let on all along and continued to hang out with Epstein anyway. Or is it proof that there is way more in this layer cake of the Gates-Epstein saga?

ZMLYS3vBuAw,2023-07-19T22:00:28Z,News & Politics,"Welcome back to the channel, friends! Today, we're peeling back the curtain on Hollywood with none other than #MelGibson leading the charge. This video delves into Gibson's journey and his upcoming expos√© on the devastating #ChildTrafficking industry worldwide.

From being an outsider in Hollywood to revealing its darkest secrets, Gibson's story is both captivating and shocking, and he's not pulling any punches against the #HollywoodElites. If you're intrigued by the #BehindTheScenes drama and the #HiddenNarratives of Hollywood, you're in for a treat.

Despite his reputation for controversy and resilience, Gibson continues to #ChallengeTheStatusQuo. His past‚Äîfrom his 2006 arrest to his self-financed production of the #PassionOfTheChrist‚Äîis as unconventional as it is notable.

His recent interactions with political figures like #DonaldTrump and Arizona's #KariLake are adding new dimensions to this narrative. The real headline-grabbing news, however, is Gibson's alleged forthcoming documentary‚Äîan expos√© on the #UndergroundChildTrafficking industry that rakes in an unfathomable $40 billion per year.

As we dive into this topic, we must question why mainstream media and elites seem intent on silencing these revelations. Could they be protecting the perpetrators? #TimBallard, a former CIA and DHS special agent, has braved the darkness, dedicating his life to rescuing these innocent children from the clutches of #ChildExploitation.

Gibson's publicist denies that any such documentary is underway, which only fuels our curiosity. Regardless, the truth is beginning to surface. We delve into this controversy and investigate the claims that platforms like Instagram could be inadvertently aiding this horrific industry.

In the era of electric cars and space exploration, there still exist many hidden ancient tribes and people about whom we know very little about. They seem almost mythical, characters out of stories or games. But in reality, they exist, living in remote areas and isolated locations, uncontacted by the outside world for years. Some of them might be friendly, others, not so much. From cannibals to people with unknown genes, today we take a look at 15 scariest tribes you don't want to meet.

Big-budget movies like ‚ÄúMission Impossible,‚Äù ‚ÄúBarbie,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOppenheimer‚Äù are drawing people in, although some, like the new ‚ÄúIndiana Jones‚Äù movie, are struggling to make back their budgets.

And with a budget of just $14.5 million, it‚Äôs set to be a huge financial success. Matt Kibbe is joined by Jeffrey Harmon‚Äîco-founder of Angel Studios, which is distributing ‚ÄúSound of Freedom‚Äù‚Äîto talk about the film‚Äôs success and the mystifying attacks from left-wing critics, most of whom haven‚Äôt even seen the movie they are decrying.

Kibbe on Liberty is a weekly podcast with libertarian author, economist, and community organizer Matt Kibbe. As the president of Free the People, Kibbe has decades of experience in the libertarian political sphere, but in these troubled times he believes that open dialogue is needed to bring people together. This means being willing to talk, and especially listen, to those with whom we might not always agree, trying to understand perspectives that might otherwise be foreign to us.

Kibbe on Liberty's growing roster of guests includes politicians, economists, comedians, writers, radio personalities, activists, journalists, and even a magician or two‚Äîwith topics of conversation ranging from current affairs to craft beer and the Grateful Dead. So grab a cold one, and settle in for the next hour of Kibbe on Liberty, mostly honest conversations with mostly interesting people.

Life expectancy in the United States is currently at 77 years‚Äîbut in the so-called ""Blue Zones,"" it is significantly higher. It is not rare for residents of these locations, which include Sardinia, Icaria, Okinawa, Nicoya, and Loma Linda, to live above the age of 100. So, if you want to live longer, it goes without saying that you should take a clue or two from their eating and drinking habits. In a Blue Zone resident's refrigerator, you won't find processed drinks like soda, sugar-sweetened juice, or sports drinks. But you will locate some of the following delicious drinks, many of which are high in disease-fighting antioxidants and other critical health-promoting elements. So here are those 4 magical drinks you should drink every day to live longer.

oKywG5hs7_8,2022-03-13T06:02:14Z,Howto & Style,"Chow Mein Recipe:
Â¶Ç‰ΩïÂà∂‰ΩúÁÇíÈù¢
Today we are making Chow Mein. Chow Mein means stir fried noodles in English. It‚Äôs a very popular street food that you can find in every neighborhood in China. Almost every Chinese restaurant has Chow Mein on their menus. People love this dish due to its smoky flavor and incredible savory taste. In this video I am going to show you guys my tips for making authentic tasting Chow Mein!

Ingredients:
3oz dry egg noodles
1/2 onion
1.5 oz bean sprouts
2 small size Bok Choy
5 cloves of garlic
1/2 cup of spring onion
1 egg
1 tsp light soy sauce
1/2 tsp dark soy sauce 
1 tsp oyster sauce 
1 tbsp cooking wine
2 tbsp cooking oil

Directions:
Let‚Äôs start with preparing the veggies. First, we are going to cut half of onion into thin slices. Get 2 Bok choy and cut the roots off. Separate the leaves from the stalks and cut them into shreds. Take one 1 spring onion. Also Separate the green part from the white part and cut them into shred. Slice about 4-5 garlic cloves into thin pieces. Crack one egg and mix well. 

Turn on the stove and add some hot water, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp cooking oil into the pot. Once water starts to boil, put about 3 OZ noodles in and let it cook for about 2-3 mins. I am using Chinese style dry egg noodles here.  If you don‚Äôt have that, you can also use spaghetti noodles. once the noodles are cooked, we will need drain them and put them into the cold water, soak for 1-2 mins to stop the cooking process. Drain the noodles again and spread them out on a tray. Once the noodles are dry, add 1 tsp of cooling oil, mix well. This way noodles will stay crunchy and won‚Äôt stick together when we cook them. 

Next, we are going to make the sauce. Put the garlic slices into a bowl and add 1 tsp of light soy sauce, 1/2 tsp of dark soy sauce, 1 tsp of oyster sauce, 1 tbs of cooking wine and 1/4 tsp of salt. Mix well.

Preheat the wok with median high heat until we can see the smoke. Add 1 tbs of cooking oil and eggs. Stir fry and break the egg into small pieces. Remove the eggs. Lower the heat to median and put the noodles in. let it cook for about 1-2 mins. Flip to the other side and cook for another 1-2 mins. once both sides are crispy, remove them and set aside. Add 1 tbs of cooking oil and cook the sprouts and onions with median high heat for about 1 min and keep adding the shredded Bok Choy stalks and white part of the green onions. Stir fry for about 30 seconds. And then bring the noodles back, pour our sauce in, mix well.  Keeping adding the Bok Choy leaves and green part of the spring onion. Stir fry for about 30 seconds. Finally add the eggs and mix everything together.","['chow mein', 'chow mein recipe', 'chinese chow mein', 'homemade chow mein', 'soy sauce chow mein', 'home made chow mein', 'cantonese chow mein', 'street style chow mein', 'chow mein panda express', 'chow mein noodles recipe', 'wok recipe', 'soy sauce supreme chow mein', 'noodle recipe', 'most popular chinese food']",oKywG5hs7_8,3,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oKywG5hs7_8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLA2NKgCJyuce7q_HXecJxOF2cX52Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKywG5hs7_8,How to Make Delicious Chow Mein in 10 Mins | ÁÇíÈù¢ | Tom Tang's Recipes,Tom Tang's Recipes,428,266376,mqQaRBlDfq8,30/07/2023 16:57,"['Food', 'Ingredient', 'Recipe', 'Staple food', 'Noodle']","['CHOW', 'MEIN', 'C']",203,143,62,1,1,1,1,1,504

2 eggs
1 cup of carrots and peas
1/2 cup of onion 
1/4 cup of green onion
1/2 tsp of salt 
1/2 tsp of sugar 

Notes:
1: Soak the rice at least 30 mins before cook the rice
2: Add little bit salt and oil to the water before boil the carrots and peas
3: Don't overcook the shrimp
4: Preheat the wok or pan before adding the rice

Directions:

Take 1 cup of the rice and wash the rice several times. Make sure to use fresh water each time until we see the clear water comes out. This step is very important. it will make the cooked rice less sticky. Soak the rice for 30 mins. Drain the rice. Add the washed rice, 1 cup of water into a rice cooker. I have always heard that fried rice is best made with day-old rice, but from my cooking experience‚Ä¶ fresh-cooked rice works too. we just need to spread the rice out on a tray and let them cool for about 20-30 mins. 

Crack 2 eggs and separate yolk from whites. Whisk the egg whites and mix the egg yolk with the rice. Marinate the shrimps by adding 1/4 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of white pepper or black pepper, 1/2 tsp of cooking wine, 1/2 corn starch and 1/4 Next, we are going to dice the carrot, onion. Chop the green onion. 

After preparing all the ingredients. Turn on the stove add some water and turn the heat on high. Once the water starts to boil, add carrots and peas. let it cook for about 2 mins. Tun the stove off and take the carrot and peas out. 

Get a fry pan. Turn the heat to median low. Add 1 tsp of oil and add the egg white. Stir fry until it‚Äôs cooked. When egg whites are cooked, remove from the pan and set aside. Add 1 tsp of oil and cook the shrimps with median high heat. Cook about 20-25 seconds for each side. Don‚Äôt overcook the shrimps, otherwise they will become hard and chewy. 

I use a traditional Chinese wok to make the fried rice since this kind wok can handle the high cooking temperature. If you don‚Äôt have a wok, you can use non-stick fry pan as well. Turn the heat to the highest. Once you see the smoke are coming from the wok. We are ready to add the oil. Add about 2 tsp of cooking oil and then add the rice. lower the heat to median low. don‚Äôt stir it immediately. let it cook for about 20 seconds. And then we are going to stir fry for about 2 mins and season it with 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of sugar. Turn the heat to medium high and add onion first. Once you can smell the aroma, add the cooked egg white, shrimp, carrots, and peas. Stir fry about 1 min until rice is separate. Add green onion; Turn the heat to max high and stir fry about 30 seconds. Give it a taste and we are DONE!!!","['easy shrimp fried rice', 'best ever shrimp fried rice', 'how to make shrimp fried rice', 'authentic shrimp fried rice recipe', 'shrimp fried rice', 'Chinese shrimp fried rice', 'easy fried rice', 'chinese stir fried rice', 'shrimp fried rice recipe', 'asian shrimp fried rice', 'how to make fried rice', 'how to make chinese fried rice', 'easy fried rice recipe', 'chinese fried rice', 'how to cook fried rice', 'chinese fried rice recipe', 'homemade fried rice', 'homemade shrimp fried rice']",iKLug36SBHQ,3,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKLug36SBHQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLAqByCeB0iT1gmuJI3qqTyPPI6QjQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKLug36SBHQ,Shrimp Fried Rice Recipe - Easy and Quick - How to (Ëôæ‰ªÅÈªÑÈáëÁÇíÈ•≠-ÂÆ∂Â∫≠ÁâàÂø´Êâã),Tom Tang's Recipes,499,504233,oKywG5hs7_8,30/07/2023 16:59,"['Glasses', 'Food', 'Recipe']","['Shrimp', 'Fried', 'Rice', 'A', 'DELICIOUS']",210,207,208,1,2,2,1,2,533

MgI2aKuT-5s,2023-06-05T23:06:47Z,People & Blogs,"UPDATE:  I made a new bread pudding video, that you can see here:  https://youtu.be/yAgl9cxU-Z0
Hey, y'all!  I'm Jan, and welcome to my attempt to video my cooking, baking, and gardening. I'm learning, so please bear with me.  The meals/baking, etc., I've been doing for decades. Recording it on anything, never. Lol  
This started as a virtual recipe book for my kids when I'm gone. Then I decided to start recording my garden as sort of a diary, especially the woes of deep south heat and humidity, and trying to keep my plants alive during summer so that they can produce until (hopefully)November. 
I don't claim to be a chef or master gardener. I'm an idiot, and probably screw up more things than I get right. 
But, I absolutely love cooking and gardening. I'll grow/cook/bake pretty much anything, once. Or, try to.
Hope you'll stick around for this journey with me!  Also, if you have any cooking requests, just yell. 

Now to the recipe: 
Bread Pudding - it's easy to make, and delicious! You can make this many different ways. But, any way you make it, you'll love it.  

You'll need: 9x13 bake dish, buttered (or two 8x8s or one deep 8x8) 
16 pieces of sandwich bread - cut into cubes or torn into one inch chunks. You can use any bread here - sandwich, brioche, biscuits, hotdog buns, etc.) Just make sure it's about equal to a loaf of bread. 
1 and 1/2 cups of Milk (or hot water) 
1- 14oz can Sweetened Condensed Milk 
3 Large eggs, beaten  
1/3 cup packed brown sugar (or granulated sugar) 
1/2 Stick of Salted butter, melted *Note- If you use unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt to the mixture. 
1 cup Raisins *Optional (you can use any thing you want.. raisins, currents, pecans, walnuts, or nothing at all
1 Tbs Vanilla (plus 1 teaspoon for the vanilla sauce)  
1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon 
1/2 cup powdered sugar (vanilla sauce) 
1 tbs milk (vanilla sauce)

In a large bowl, whisk together your milk, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, butter, sugar, cinnamon. 
In your greased bake dish, pour your bread cubes in and raisins (if using). 
Then pour your milk/egg/sugar batter over your bread 
Take a spoon on your hand and press the bread down into the liquid to make sure all bread is absorbing some milk mixture.  
Let sit 30 minutes or even over night. 

Oven at 350F (180C) 
Bake 30-40 minutes.  

*Optional Vanilla Sauce 
1/2 cup powdered sugar 
1 teaspoon vanilla 
1 tbs milk  
Mix well, and drizzle over your bread pudding once it comes out of the oven.  
-- You can also top it with ice cream, cool whip, syrup. Anything you like.

Enjoy!
 
**You can freeze this if you want to bake it ahead. Place in fridge 24 hours before needed, to thaw it.

Today, we have an exciting recipe to take your bread-making skills to the next level. 
We will make delicious homemade ciabatta rolls using a simple no-knead method, just the stretch and fold method.  
These rolls are light, airy, and packed with flavour. The best part? You won't believe how easy they are to make! So, let's dive right in and get started!


Easy Homemade Ciabatta Rolls - No-Knead Recipe
Ingredients:
400g warm water
Two teaspoons honey
500g white bread flour
21g fast-action yeast
7g salt
Olive oil 

Instructions:
Combine the white bread flour, salt, and fast-action yeast in a large mixing bowl.

In a separate bowl, mix the warm water with honey until the honey is dissolved.

Pour the honey water mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients while stirring. Continue stirring until a sticky dough forms.

Transfer the sticky dough to a large, well-oiled (use olive oil) bowl to prevent sticking. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and rest for 20 minutes.

Before stretching the dough, wet your hands with olive oil or water to prevent sticking.

After 20 minutes, gently stretch and fold the dough. Try to be very gentle and keep the dough airy.

Cover the bowl again and let it rest for another 20 minutes. 

Repeat this stretching and folding process four times, with 20 minutes of rest between each round.

Before the last two stretches, preheat the oven to 180-200¬∞C (350-390¬∞F). Place a metal container inside the oven as well.


Once the dough has gone through the final two stretches and folds, it's time to shape the rolls. Dust your work surface with flour and flip the bowl upside down to release the dough onto the surface. 

Use a knife or dough cutter to gently cut the dough into desired sizes and shape the rolls.
Transfer the shaped rolls onto a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.

Place the tray in the oven and add hot water to the preheated metal container; it generates steam.
Bake the ciabatta rolls for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.

Once baked, remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.

Your homemade ciabatta rolls are now ready to be enjoyed! They are perfect for sandwiches, sliders, or served alongside soups and salads.
 
 
Thank you for watching, and enjoy your Ciabatta rolls.

It is a bread with two or more types of grain packed with lots of nutrients and other goodies. 
Ingredients: 
250g Strong Flour 
30g White Rye Flour 
30g Buckwheat Flour 
80g Spelt Wholemeal Flour 
300g Water 
7g Yeast 
9g Honey 
15g Salt 
Mix the seeds as you like; I use 
Two tablespoons of fried onion (essential it gives a pleasant smell) 
One tablespoon of pumpkin seeds.
One tablespoon of sesame seeds.
One tablespoon of sunflower seeds. 
Mix the following ingredients: 
Water, salt, yeast, honey. 
One by one, add all measured flour. 
For this bread, I used a kitchen mixer. You can knead bread by hand or use other techniques like stretch and fold. 
https://youtu.be/MQ9wXDMQngU
In the beginning, the dough is very wet and sticky. Keep kneading until it starts pulling off from the mixing bowl. You can add more bread flour if the dough is too wet. 
When your dough is ready, add mixed seeds and don't forget about fried onion, then give a little stir. 
Cover until it's doubled in size. 
Preheat the oven to 200C and place a metal pan or tray to create steam. 
Dust very well surface with flour and remove dough from the bowl. 
Make a rectangle shape, fold and roll before putting it into a proofing basket or baking tray. 
Let it proof until it has doubled the size. 
Baking When the dough rises well, gently place it on a tray and score. 
Then bake for 30-35min at 200c. 
Before closing the door, adds hot water to preheat the tray to create steam. 
Before cutting the first slice, cool down the bread for at least 30 minutes.
Enjoy:)

Cold proofing flips the process upside down. The bulk fermentation is done at room temperature and the final proof is finished in the fridge. Cold proofing is the perfect method for breakfast bakes because all you need to do the next day is pre-heat the oven and bake the bread. You can find a few recipes using this method in the Cold Fermented Dough playlist. 

Little ciabatta rolls are ideal for breakfast. They are hearty, taste great, and can hold a lot of topping/fillings. You can leave them as they are, or you can toast them. What makes this recipe even better is that there is no kneading. The dough is simply folded a few times during bulk fermentation instead.

YF46pcuey3o,2023-07-22T19:00:11Z,Howto & Style,"Homemade Wholemeal Spelt Bread

This recipe makes delicious and nutritious wholemeal spelt bread with a lovely nutty flavour and chewy texture.

Ingredients:
500g organic wholemeal spelt flour
10g salt
11g fast action yeast
350g warm water
2 tbsp pumpkin seeds (optional)
2 tbsp pine nuts (optional)

Instructions:
‚Ä¢ Combine the dry ingredients (flour, salt, yeast) in a large mixing bowl. Mix well to distribute evenly.
‚Ä¢ Add the warm water and mix to form a shaggy dough.
‚Ä¢ Let the dough rest for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate and the gluten to develop.
‚Ä¢ Wet your hands to prevent sticking. Fold the dough over itself five times to strengthen the gluten network.
‚Ä¢ Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in size.
‚Ä¢ Punch down the dough to release air bubbles. Wet your hands or use olive oil before folding the optional pumpkin seeds and pine nuts for added flavour and texture.
‚Ä¢ Divide dough into two portions for smaller loaves, or shape into one large round loaf to bake in a bread tin. Let rise until doubled in size again.
‚Ä¢ Preheat oven to 200¬∞C. Place a small oven-proof dish with hot water on the bottom rack to create steam.
‚Ä¢ Bake smaller loaves for 30 minutes directly on a baking sheet. Or bake a large loaf for 35-40 minutes in a greased tin.

‚Ä¢ Cool before slicing, and enjoy the hearty homemade spelt bread!

Here is some quick information about the benefits of using wholemeal spelt flour:
‚Ä¢ Higher protein content than regular wheat flour - Spelt contains more protein which provides sustained energy.
‚Ä¢ More nutrients - Milling the whole spelt grain preserves all the nutritional bran and germ, making it richer in B vitamins, minerals like iron and magnesium, and fibre.
‚Ä¢ Easier to digest - The gluten in spelt flour is more soluble, making it easier to break down for people with sensitivities.
‚Ä¢ Nutty, sweet flavour - Spelt has a delicious nutty taste and sweetness that comes through in baked goods.
‚Ä¢ Doesn't require strong gluten development - The gluten strands in spelt are more fragile, so it doesn't need intensive kneading.
‚Ä¢ Denser texture - The lower gluten content gives spelt bread a pleasant dense, and chewy texture.

So, in summary, wholemeal spelt flour makes wonderfully tasty and nutritious bread packed with protein, fibre and important nutrients! Let me know if you need any other spelt flour facts.

Roast spuds are the best part of any roast dinner. You know how it is - you have to cook extra because everyone around the table has room for more!

If there's one thing I've learned, is that you can't beat cooking them in the traditional way. The question is, how can we get the taste of a traditionally cooked roast potato, with the speed and convenience of using the air fryer? Ta-da! The answer lies in this video.

The air fryer offers health benefits and allows us to cook food using the minimum amount of oil. The crisper plate helps the hot air to circulate around the food and food is crisp and cooked much quicker ...BUT, using the crisper plate with just a spray of oil can result in quite dry roast potatoes.

I've experimented and tried this different ways and cooking them in a more traditional way on the base of the air fryer in a few tablespoons of oil, results in a far superior roastie ...and they'll be cooked in a fraction of the time it takes in a conventional oven.

Follow my tip for that crispy exterior and use a good quality floury potato for that soft, fluffy interior.

BytjO9qAEQM,2023-05-30T15:09:32Z,People & Blogs,"Wow! This is one of my best air fryer recipes. These Yorkshire puddings were stellar! I've perfected this recipe after much trial and error ...and I believe I've produced Yorkshire puddings that are FAR better than anything I've ever made in the oven.

This method resulted in huge, inflated, pillows of crispiness, with just the right amount of breadiness inside for mopping up your gravy.

I think the secret is not to have too much flour, a reasonable amount of milk and to use decent sized shallow tins. The usual rules apply: the oil needs to be smoking hot before you pour the batter in, you need to work quickly, and once the drawer is closed, don't open it again until they're cooked.

They literally take 16 minutes to cook - that's half the cooking time they'd have in the oven, not to mention how long it would take your regular oven to preheat to such a high temperature!

These truly are AMAZING! Give them a go and let me know how they turned out for you.

DIY Chalk Paint Recipe:
2 parts acrylic or latex paint
1 part pure talc (Do not use cornstarch baby powder it won't work because the cornstarch is too slippery!) Here are a couple of links to talc products:
https://www.amazon.com/Lab-Grade-Talc-Powder-Mesh-500g/dp/B0787MM9DH/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=talc&amp;qid=1620824376&amp;sr=8-3

Mix very well, shaking is best. Check the paint often to make sure that the all the talc is incorporated. Use on any dull surface such as raw wood, plastic, metal. If you are gluing the project onto something, glue it first, then paint it. Sometimes the baby powder doesn't hold the glue very well.

A new way to freeze basil! Ditch the ice cube trays filled with olive oil‚Äî you don‚Äôt need them!

This basil freezing method is a quick and easy way to preserve a lot of fresh basil.

Use 1 tablespoon of olive oil for every 3 cups of fresh, lightly packed basil leaves.

6 cups of basil fits in a quart bag. Use multiple quart bags instead of moving up to a gallon size for more.

Slice up your cucumbers and add 1 tsp of dill to the jar 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp to 2 tsp of minced or chopped garlic.

hOf7pzm-TcM,2023-07-26T16:00:34Z,People & Blogs,"King Charles evicts disgraced Prince Andrew from Buckingham Palace. King Charles has sensationally sent his disgraced brother Prince Andrew packing, according to reports.

The scandal-scarred royal, who was famously stripped of his royal and military honors by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, has been told to find a new place to live immediately, the Sun reports.
‚ÄúThe king has made it clear that Buckingham Palace is no place for Prince Andrew,‚Äù a source told the outlet of the decision, which comes just months before King Charles III‚Äôs coronation, set for May 6.
Andrew, who has had his back against the wall since his alleged friendship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein came to light, has been told ‚Äúthere is no longer any place‚Äù for him at Buckingham Palace, the official royal residence. First his office closed last year and now his sleeping quarters,‚Äù the insider told the Sun. ‚ÄúAndrew loved having a suite at Buckingham Palace, where he was not only set up for marital life with Sarah Ferguson but used it as a bachelor‚Äôs pad after his divorce.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHe brought back a string of new girlfriends to his home in the palace ‚Äî even model Caprice. A bachelor‚Äôs flat in St James‚Äô Palace doesn‚Äôt have the same allure for a single man,‚Äù the source added. 

A 10-year-long renovation, costing upward of $400 million, is reportedly due to take place at the palace, which includes Andrew‚Äôs suite, known as the Chamber Floor. If Andrew wishes to stay in London, King Charles has reportedly told him that his only other option is his other royal residence, St. James. Andrew also shares a 31-room Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. The eviction serves as a fresh blow to Andrew, who was kicked out of his Buckingham Palace office last year.

‚ÄúAny presence at the palace is officially over,‚Äù a source told the outlet in December. ‚ÄúThe king has made it clear. He isn‚Äôt a working royal. He‚Äôs on his own.‚Äù Andrew, who was barred from using his HRH (‚ÄúHis Royal Highness‚Äù) moniker following his association with pedophile Epstein, also lost his patronages last year. While he is still a Royal Knight of the Garter and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, he was told face to face by his mother that he would no longer be known as His Royal Highness.

The monarch, who was 94 when she died in September, broke the news to the father of two at Windsor Castle in January last year. That same month, she also took away his military titles. With the Queen‚Äôs approval and agreement, the Duke of York‚Äôs military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen,‚Äù Buckingham Palace said in a statement at the time. The retraction of Andrew‚Äôs official royal labels came amid his sexual assault case filed by Virginia Giuffre, who has long claimed that Epstein made her have ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù sex with the royal three times, starting in 2001 when she was just 17.

_g0169ZBwcs,2023-07-14T23:04:40Z,News & Politics,"BACKSTORY: 
Incredible drone video(taken from my drone) from the landslide that is occurring in 8 Peartree Lane in Rolling Hills Estates shows just how much damage the landslide has caused to the houses there, even splitting rooms in half. In one of the videos, a kids basketball rim can be seen in a backyard, with the backyard being nearly cut in half right in front of the basketball rim where kids play. In another video, it can be seen that a bedroom &amp; living room are split in half right where the beds and couches are. It can even be seen that some houses have the top of their roof being on the same level as the sidewalk that was used to walk into their houses. What‚Äôs most noticeable from all the footage is a big split/line in the land that shows the land sliding into the canyon, almost looking like a scene seen in the famous movie ‚Äú2012‚Äù.

It‚Äôs important to note that from the last post that I covered about this, it was only 12 houses that were evacuated due to this natural disaster, however, now less than a dozen or so more houses have been evacuated, and another 17 more homes are being monitored by the LA County Fire Department (LACoFD). This comes as the LACoFD determines that this landslide is bigger than what they had originally thought, and now more homes are in danger. LACoFD had stated all they could do at this point is let nature do its thing and wait until all the houses fall into the canyon, as it is too dangerous and risky to go in as the land is still sliding. The land has so far shifted 20 feet since it started, and it continues to grow. Professionals who cover Geological Sciences state that the landslide is most likely not 100% due to the steepness of the hill or the rocks below - as the land is moving way too fast for that to be the main cause -  but rather it is water that can cause this land to move fast. Speculations state that this year's heavy rains were what could be a major factor that could have caused water to play a main role in the landslide. This landslide will go down in history for being one of the most unprecedented &amp; major landslides in the South Bay, and even in California. 

To make matters even worse, criminals have taken advantage of the evacuated houses, and on 7/13 some had broken into the evacuated houses and taken items&amp; belongings of those who lived there. Luckily the LA County Sheriff's Department(lomita station), and with the help of the Torrance Police Department, were able to catch the suspects and arrest them in a difficult search. Bravo!

In this real human trafficking story, we are share Belle's remarkable journey and the powerful reunion between Belle and her family. Subscribe: https://bit.ly/2RhELf3

Belle was born in Romania to a lower-income family. Because of the poverty in the area, child human trafficking is not uncommon. In Belle‚Äôs situation, the doctors in her hospital stole her from her family to a human trafficking orphanage where she was adopted by a family for a large sum. Her story is one of incredible persistence of trying to find her family. When we heard about her story at Operation Underground Railroad, we stepped in to help her reunite and meet her family for the first time. You will be in awe with her story and you won‚Äôt want to miss this amazingly beautiful reunion.

As a devout Christian with tee-total parents, getting into character as a paedophile was always going to be a stretch for Tony Kirwan. ""I was extremely uncomfortable when I first started doing this"", says Kirwan. Yet his distress at the world of sleaze and exploitation emboldened him to pose as its worst type of customer. After becoming aware of the scale of child trafficking in Thailand, he founded Destiny Rescue, a charity funded by donations and mostly staffed by volunteers. ""I've got no specific skills in this other than I guess a heart of a dad"", he says. Now he is part of a motley crew with no background in law enforcement, whose assistance to under-resourced local police is essential. ""At any time we'd have a couple of dozen agents around the world in six different countries, ready to go out into the brothels... and get some people arrested and more children rescued"", says Kirwan. He claims to have seen 2,500 children and young adults rescued from trafficking in the last seven years, with an 80% success rate in not returning. We watch as months of preparation come to a head, culminating in the biggest raid in Destiny Rescue's history.

Ten years ago, Jessa Crisp escaped her last trafficker. If there is one thing that her life says is the reality that although healing is a life long process, it is possible. 2017 will forever be the year that Jessa shared her story on camera for the first time, on our platform, in greater detail, giving hope to SO many men and women from all around the world. Sharing her story might have been one of the most challenging experiences of her life.

Many have complained about low sound issues in the original video and so we have decided to fix it and now it's much better. In this movie--for those who haven't watched--Jessa has bravely recounted how she overcame a childhood of being gang raped, sexually abused by family members and trafficked. Her abuse started aged 10 in her home country of Canada where she was molested by members of her own family. As a child, she was made to pose for pornographers, had to perform degrading sex acts and was raped in front of the cameras.

Some people might be recognizing Jessa because of her story. Jessa does not want to be defined by her past, she wants to share her story, however, she doesn't want to be known for it. For us, Jessa Crisp is a victor and and a role model: she shows what it means to be a strong, resilient human being. She keeps chasing her dreams, and never gives up. We are proud to announce that Jessa is now officially graduated with her M.A. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. BRAVO.

This story needs to go viral. If you agree please share and help us and Jessa raise awareness.

7YPAjiPnfIY,2023-07-01T13:55:12Z,People & Blogs,"The late last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, had three marriages in his lifetime. Apart from his second queen, Soraya, who did not bear him any children, his first and third wives gave birth to a total of five children. Today, we will talk about the story of the first child of the Shah, Shahnaz Pahlavi.

Shahnaz Pahlavi was born on October 27, 1940, in Tehran, Iran. She was the only child of Mohammad Reza Shah and his first wife, Fawzia, who was an Egyptian princess. Her birth was accompanied by great regret and unease within the Pahlavi family. Years ago, Mohammad Reza Shah's father, Reza Shah, had heard a prophecy that if the first child born to the royal family was a girl, the king would be killed or exiled. (Obviously, this absurd prophecy eventually came true). Furthermore, before Shahnaz's birth, everyone in the court anticipated that Shah's wife would give birth to a male heir, and celebrations had been planned accordingly. However, all the planned festivities were canceled when people learned that the queen had given birth to a baby girl. As a result, one can imagine the magnitude of disappointment within the Pahlavi family regarding Shahnaz's birth. Nonetheless, Shahnaz's father still felt some consolation in the birth of his daughter, as evident from the name he chose for her.

This is perhaps one of the most important interviews on one of the most important yet too often silenced, overlooked, ignored, and normalized crises in the world. 

And it is happening in our own backyards. The US is the number 1 consumer of child trafficking in the world and the Super Bowl (just 11 days away) is historically the biggest trafficking event. 

My courageous guest today has held a special place in my heart since the first time I heard her speak. And as much as I want to believe that her story is a rare occurrence, unfortunately, it is not.

Elizabeth Frazier is a sex trafficking survivor, hero, and inspiration for anyone who is struggling to cope with trauma or pain. 

From being groomed for trafficking at just 4 years old and enduring over 20 years of abuse, Elizabeth did not let it destroy her. As a successful entrepreneur and motivational speaker, she is STILL a believer that even through your worst experiences, everything in life happens FOR you and not TO you.

In this interview, Elizabeth shares her story, her journey to healing, and warning signs that someone you know may be a victim of sex trafficking. 

No matter what you are going through, this interview will teach you practical skills to no let trauma become your emotional home.

We can all relate to each other through our pain. You are not alone. You can come back from the darkest of places.

If you see or suspect someone is a victim of sex trafficking call the National Human Trafficking Hotline 1 (888) 373-7888 or Text ‚ÄúHELP‚Äù or ‚ÄúINFO‚Äù to 233733.

OsBmCMsu-Ms,2023-07-01T11:00:16Z,People & Blogs,"Life in the mountains of a 96-year-old grandmother. Far from civilization at the edge of the world.
The grandmother lives alone, but her daughter is always nearby. Helps around the house, with medicines. My daughter's husband helps with firewood. At the age of 96, the grandmother is doing well.
Living in such an isolated and natural environment can be both challenging and rewarding.
Every day, the grandmother wakes up in front of breathtaking views of majestic mountains and lush greenery.
Life in such a remote place causes difficulties. Harsh weather conditions, limited access to modern amenities and potential health problems.

In this vlog, I tried to go to new places by myself. Going to new places can be scary especially when you go alone. But I think the reason we step out of our comfort zone is to become comfortable. I plan to do this more often in future vlogs. I tend to gravitate towards familiar and older places which there is nothing bad about. But it does prevent me from seeking new places to explore.

Anyways I will see you all next week!

oaIA4-__qoU,2019-08-20T12:35:12Z,People & Blogs,"Here you get a great recipe for zucchini boats with a spiced-up ground beef and vegetable stuffing. We use the zucchini meat as part of the stuffing in order to not waste such a great ingredient. 

Ingredients for 4 persons: 
4 zucchinis 
1/2 kg / 1 pound of ground beef
 2 small or 1 large onion 
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 tsp of dry basilic
2 tsp ground cumin
10cherry tomatoes, chopped up finely
2 eggs
3 tbsp breadcrumbs
200 gr. / 7 oz yellow cheddar, shredded
150 gr. / 5 oz. parmesan cheese, shredded
salt &amp; pepper

For the tomato sauce: 
1 can / 14,5 oz. whole peeled tomatoes
1-2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 cloves of garlic, minced
salt &amp; pepper
a pinch of sugar

- Half each zucchini and scoop out the flesh of each one.
- Chop up the flesh into smaller bits.
- Fry minced beef in neutral oil at medium to high heat until most water has evaporated.
- Add chopped onions and fry until transluscent.
- Add chopped cherry tomatoes and zucchini flesh to the pan and let water evaporate.
- Add spices and garlic to the pan and season to your liking.
- Remove the filling and transfer to two bowls to cool off slightly (20 minutes or so). 
- In a clean bowl: mix can of tomatoes with garlic, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper until almost homogenous. Mash the omatoes a bit. 
- Add grated cheddar and parmesan cheese and eggs to the filling. Mix well.
- Add the tomato sauce to a rectangular lasagna dish and place zucchini boats on top. 
- Fill each boat with the filling and top with more cheese for garnish.
- Cook in the oven 40 minutes at 200 deg. C / 390 deg. F
- Let the zucchini boats cool off slightly (15 min or so) before serving with tomato sauce and fx. cooked rice, a good loaf of bread or pasta! 

Enjoy :-)

Hello everyone, my name is Julie and on Thrilled Thrifter you will find that I absolutely love thrift shopping.(Especially for home decor!) I want to share all things thrift here on my channel to teach you how to go thrifting for your home, family and friends. {I'm not a reseller!}  I mostly thrift at Goodwill, yard/garage sales, FB marketplace, antique stores, estate sales and so many other local thrift stores. I believe you can make your home beautiful on a thrifty budget! I will take you on so many thrift with me shopping trips, share my thrift hauls and almost always show you how to use thrift finds in your home. I post every Friday and sometimes on Tuesday. Occasionally I do thrift flips and decorating videos too! I hope you walk away from my channel  feeling inspired to shop secondhand. Don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss out!

UVgZgUXF93A,2023-07-22T23:07:46Z,People & Blogs,"Richard had surgery a couple of weeks ago, and we don't feel good about leaving him home. He had two big tumors removed, one along his ribs and the other along his stomach. So, we tried to take him thrifting since he has been really bummed about not being able to go out.

We asked if we could take him inside, they said yes, and he was good for about 15 minutes. He was just restless, and it was a new experience. I do plan to try to take him again in the future just to keep getting him adjusted to going into dog-friendly places. However, with thrifting, I think it might be better if Michael and I go alone from now on.

He gets his stitches out next week, so we will be free. We will miss our little bud, but he gets to work from home every day of the week. So if we thrift for a couple of hours, I bet he will love the silence and peace he gets hanging at home with his sister, Wren.

Stopping along my road trip route at each vintage store I spotted, I scored some pretty adorable vintage and retro items for cheap! Plus, much to my adoring surprise, some antique stores were having Christmas in July sales, which were an adorable treat. 
Stay tuned in a coming video when I put those cute heart cabinet knobs to use, refurnishing something special I found a few weeks ago.
As always, thanks for watching, and let me know if there was anything in this thrifting video that you would have bought yourself!

r9byNQVW0LM,2020-06-14T00:16:57Z,People & Blogs,"Here‚Äôs a demonstration of the watercolor paper stretching technique that I've been using successfully now for 30 years. Some highlights from the video:

Stretching watercolor paper is important to keep it from rippling and wrinkling during the painting process.

Stretching also softens the paper and makes it more water-absorbent and receptive to watercolor paint.

The coating of gelatin sizing on unstretched hot press paper causes paint to bead on the surface, producing hard drying lines. Stretching helps remove some of this gelatin and prepares the paper for even, subtle washes.

The very smoothest Arches watercolor paper is 140 lb. hot press. You can paint on 300 lb. hot press if you want to avoid stretching paper, but it is slightly rougher than 140 lb. hot press paper. And 300 lb. paper will still warp and deform when it gets really wet.

The full-size (22x30-inch) Arches watercolor paper sheets seem to be better quality than the Arches paper you get on a pad or in a block or roll. This is my own observation based on personal experience‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve done over 300 watercolor paintings to date, and the best results were always on Arches full-size sheets either stretched on a large drawing board or cut into smaller pieces and stretched separately.

I stretch paper on plywood. Birch or maple is the smoothest, but just about any rigid wood surface will do, as long as it‚Äôs thick enough and clean! If it‚Äôs a new piece of wood fresh from the lumber yard or if you have sanded it, wash it down and then dry it with a paper towel and be sure the paper towel isn‚Äôt stained from the wood afterwards. You don‚Äôt want to contaminate the back of your painting with wood residue. 

Before using any interior grade plywood as a drawing board, I paint over the edges with acrylic gesso to prevent moisture from seeping in and de-laminating the board. 

A Masonite drawing board (like the ones with built-in clips that many art students use) is not recommended for stretching watercolor paper, unless you want to watch your drawing board slowly bend itself in half.

I use 2-inch Kraft paper tape to attach the wet paper sheet to a plywood drawing board. This will hold the paper securely if you press the tape down firmly and if it's not too wet. Some people use staples in addition to or instead of tape, but I've never found this necessary.

When your painting is finished, cut it off the drawing board and trim the tape off the edges. You can remove the remaining tape from your drawing board by soaking it with water and then scrape it off. If it doesn't come off easily, just soak it longer.

Art supply vendors, please stop putting product stickers on the FRONT of Arches watercolor sheets! Even if they peel off, the glue damages the paper, which then needs to be trimmed down to remove the damaged section.

Thanks for watching, and please let me know in the comments if you have any questions.

We got a call about a dog who was lying in the middle of the road in Thermal for over an hour and could not move. They were not sure if he had been hit by a car but there was blood on his paws. It was 115 degrees and the dog was sitting on hot pavement. The heat alone was going to kill him. His situation was dire.

His most recent work focused on the flora around him, transforming what he finds into carved masterpieces, then adding flat vibrant bright colours to his pieces, creating the perfect combination of organic, natural shapes and clean, simple forms.

His interest in Bushman rock art is fascinating, and a clear Matisse influence is noticeable in his work. 

Guy places emphasis on the value of keeping your ideas to yourself and nurturing them through the process of creating your work, and then ultimately unveiling the final completed masterpiece. His work has deep symbolic meaning and his carving techniques, colour use and print methods speak of many years of practice and each piece is perfectly rounded off.

Thank you so much for opening your colourful home to us and letting us experience your magnificent working process.

Note: on the essential oils one you can also use half distilled water and half witch hazel. Witch hazel helps the oil and water combine easier and will help the scent linger for a longer period of time. 

And if you ask Martha Stewart she will suggest getting a clear spray bottle and add sprigs of wildflowers or herbs to make it look pretty too!

SrPk69rSkA0,2022-01-21T22:51:50Z,Howto & Style,"In today's video I show you how to unclog toilet without a plunger.  As well as unclog toilet with dish soap and hot water method.  I have been using this hack for about 10 years with great success.  If you do not have a plunger available, this method works great as all it takes is some dish soap and a bowl.

Dawn dish soap available on Amazon here - https://amzn.to/3rD5qnl

Step one is to take your dish soap and pour a generous amount in.  I usually do about one cup full.  Then let it sit in your toilet for a minimum of 45 minutes, but 90 minutes is ideal.  The majority of the time, the dish soap will unclog the clog within this 90 minute window and you will hear it flush on it's on.  

If it does not unclog, proceed to step two.  Take some hot water from your faucet (not boiling) and slowly pour it into the toilet in a circular motion.  Let the hot water sit in the toilet for 30 minutes.  

If after 30 minutes, your toilet is still not unclogged, flush the toilet.  It is recommended to have the same bowl next to your toilet in the event the clog did not clear and your toilet starts to overflow.  You can use the bowl to remove the water as it is filling up.

This is my second video on how to unclog a toilet without a plunger.  My first video has helped almost 800k people according to the comments and I wanted to make an updated video for 2022 and explain a few more additional tips and explain why this method works so well.

If you found this video helpful, please give it a like, feel free to comment (I respond to all comments) and subscribe for more future informative videos!

YgOYLDf5Wv8,2021-03-26T21:27:10Z,Howto & Style,"Another awesome day in North Alabama today friends.    After  really rough day yesterday,  with tornadoes running all through the state, we are out catching a huge honeybee swarm from a cedar tree.   
  I can't believe  it myself that this is the second swarm I've caught so far and both queens were captured before I ever shook the branch.  This is really making swarm catching fun.  
   I hope you all are enjoying my 2021 Bee season kickoff with these swarm shakes.  I sure am.   I believe  it puts me ahead of my buddy's  Jpthebeeman, 628DirtRooster and Jeff Horchoff.   Although I know they will catch up quick, it's nice to lead the race at some point.   
    Enjoy everyone and I hope you enjoyed a little fun from Yappybeeman.

 I get calls like this all the time, something flying in a small hole and it looks like bees or yellow jacket wasps. sometimes even for a squirrel or a raccoon. I enjoy every new experience when it comes to removing bees from structures. Construction obstacles always seem to challenge me with every job. As a bee remover, I find the good and bad in construction design. Some things look great but make it easy for bees to set up shop and call it home also. Other times, bees move in due to a lack of home maintainace. But no matter the reason, Yappy Beeman is ready to come rescue the honey bees. 

 Check out my friends video channels also. Jpthebeeman , 628Dirtroosterbees and Jeff Horchoff for some more great honey bee videos.

Yappy Beeman is a professional bee remover  performing  live honey bee removals in Alabama as ""Alabama Bee Rescue"" and relocates them to apiaries away from residential areas so they can rebuild and thrive as a honey bee colony producing honey. Yappy is an Alabama Beekeepers association member that has performed over 500 live bee removals. Yappy with the help of his great friend and mentor; JpTheBeeman, a professional beekeeper , has learned many skills to remove bee swarms and honey bee colonies safely for the bees and homeowners alike.","['honeybee', 'Swarmofbees', 'beeremovalvideos', 'Yappybeeman', 'Jothebeeman', '628dirtrooster', 'jeffhorchoff', '2021swarmcatch', 'queenbee', 'honeybee marching']",YgOYLDf5Wv8,3,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YgOYLDf5Wv8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwE8CKgBEF5IWvKriqkDLwgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AfABAfgB1AaAAuADigIMCAAQARhlIGAoQDAP&rs=AOn4CLC6f7SjuyvNyypnD9A-EaKlPxlBWw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgOYLDf5Wv8,If I Hadn't Caught It On Camera You Wouldn't Have Believed Me,Yappy Beeman   ,439,32483476,JPOrHfxX32k,31/07/2023 10:19,"['Plant', 'Tree']",[],94,79,56,2,1,1,1,1,857

Simplicity and dark rich wood tones will help us create a somewhat cozier look as we prepare for the upcoming fall season.  We did a small renovation in our home that I'm over the moon about too, so I hope you will enjoy watching my Late Summer Home Decorating come together.

Today is also a special collaboration with so many of my favorite YouTube creators.

We've all teamed up to bring you some late summer home inspiration to help you enjoy the rest of the summer season before all of the wonderful Fall videos come out. 

We're all a little different, which is what I love about this group of talented creators.  Be sure to head to their channels and say hi!

UNMrwudowfg,2022-08-05T15:17:34Z,Howto & Style,"Let me show you a simple Mexican-inspired rice and beans recipe you and your friends can enjoy.
‚û°Ô∏è Black beans are a good source of fiber, proteins, and vitamins. 
Coupling with the fragrant basmati rice, peppers, cilantro, and lemon juice only ensures this meal is both aromatic and healthy at the same time. 

The addition of strained tomatoes, cumin, paprika, and cayenne spices gives this dish the flavor we look for in Mexican-inspired meals.
 ‚û°Ô∏è This dish is for sure one of the easiest, most aromatic, and flavorful meals you could quickly fire up from your kitchen.
You now have one recipe in your back pocket you could go to whenever you need a Mexican-inspired meal or just to have an excuse to open that can of black beans in the back of your pantry.

üí¨ Is there another Mexican-inspired dish you'd like to see me prepare? Let me know in the comments below.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è RECIPE INGREDIENTS:  (4 servings approx.)

1 Cup / 200g White Basmati Rice (washed thoroughly with water)
2 Cups / 1 Can (540ml Can) Cooked Black Beans OR Pinto Beans (drained/rinsed)
3 Tablespoon Olive Oil
1 +1/2 / 200g Cup Onion - Chopped
1 Cup / 150g Green Bell Pepper - Chopped
1 Cup / 150g Red Bell Pepper - Chopped
2 Tablespoon Garlic - finely chopped
3/4 Cup / 175ml Strained Tomatoes / Passata / Tomato Puree
1 Teaspoon Cumin
1 Teaspoon Paprika
1/4 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper or to taste
1 Cup / 125g Frozen Corn kernels (you can use fresh corn)
1 Cup / 240ml (low sodium) Vegetable Broth **OR AS REQUIRED
‚úÖüëâ (**NOTE - Sometimes one batch of basmati rice is dried than the other so may require more liquid to cook. SO ADJUST ACCORDINGLY)
Salt to Taste (I have added total 1+3/4 Tsp of Pink Himalayan Salt)

Garnish:
1+1/2 cup / 100g Green Onion - chopped
1/2 to 3/4 cup / 20 to 30g Cilantro (Coriander leaves) or to taste - chopped
OPTIONAL - Lime or Lemon juice to taste (Taste the rice first and ADD ONLY IF IT‚ÄôS NEEDED, I have added 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice as I like it a bit sour)
Black pepper to taste (I added 1/2 teaspoon)
Drizzle of extra virgin Olive oil (I have added 1 tablespoon of organic cold pressed olive oil)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è METHOD:

Thoroughly wash the rice - a few times until the water runs clear. Drain 1 can of black beans. Set the rice and beans aside to drain any excess water.

(Use a Wider Pot to cook this dish, the rice will cook more evenly without getting mushy).

To a heated pot add olive oil, red and green bell pepper, salt and fry on medium to medium high heat (depending on the heat of your stove) until the onions and pepper starts to caramelize. Adding salt to onion/peppers will release it's moisture and help it cook faster, so don‚Äôt skip it.

Once the onion starts to caramelize, add the garlic and fry for about 1 minute or until fragrant.  Then add the strained tomatoes, ground cumin, paprika, cayenne and mix well. Add the washed rice, cooked black beans, corn kernels, salt, vegetable broth and mix well. Bring to a boil and then cover and cook on low heat for about 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked (but not mushy).

Uncover and turn off the heat. Add the chopped green onion, cilantro, lemon juice, black pepper, drizzle of olive oil and mix it very gently because rice is very soft at this point and over mixing can cause the rice grains to break.

(NOTE: taste the rice before adding lemon juice and add lemon juice ONLY IF NEEDED)

Cover and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. This recipe is perfect for meal planning and can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è IMPORTANT TIPS:

- Use a Wider Pot to cook this dish, so that the rice can cook more evenly without getting mushy
- Every stove is different so regulate the heat accordingly
- The Cooking time depends on several factors - the type of pot being used, heat of the stove, moisture content of the ingredients etc. so please use your judgement and adjust the cooking time accordingly
- Thoroughly wash the rice until the water runs clear to get rid of any impurities/gunk (it's an important step so please do not skip it)
- This recipe is for white basmati rice, if you are using a different kind of rice adjust the water accordingly

Linguine with Shrimp Scampi
RECIPE COURTESY OF INA GARTEN
Level: Easy
Total: 25 min
Prep: 10 min
Cook: 15 min
Yield: 3 servings

Ingredients

Vegetable oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt plus 1 1/2 teaspoons
3/4 pound linguine
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 1/2 tablespoons good olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic (4 cloves)
1 pound large shrimp (about 16 shrimp), peeled and deveined
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves
1/2 lemon, zest grated
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons)
1/4 lemon, thinly sliced in half-rounds
1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes

Directions

Drizzle some oil in a large pot of boiling salted water, add 1 tablespoon of salt and the linguine, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, or according to the directions on the package.

Meanwhile, in another large (12-inch), heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Be careful, the garlic burns easily! Add the shrimp, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and the pepper and saute until the shrimp have just turned pink, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat, add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, and red pepper flakes. Toss to combine.

When the pasta is done, drain the cooked linguine and then put it back in the pot. Immediately add the shrimp and sauce, toss well, and serve.

SjQxCW4HIq0,2021-04-01T20:37:42Z,Howto & Style,"In this video, I show you how to update oak cabinets without paint by using Briwax! This is an easy and inexpensive DIY kitchen cabinet update on a budget! 

*PLEASE NOTE*
1. This is my personal experience. You may get different results. I‚Äôm not a professional. 

2. Briwax has a VERY strong odor! 

3. As others have pointed out, it does NOT work on wood that has a polyurethane finish to it. The Briwax will not stick.

4. I suggest trying it on the back of a cabinet door first to see if you get the results you want. 

5. If you have specific questions, you can contact Briwax on their website.

Ingredients for Red Velvet Cake

‚Öî cup (140 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 cup (400 g) sugar
2 large large eggs, at room temperature
2 tsp (10 ml) vanilla extract
2 ¬Ω cup (375 g) all-purpose flour
¬º cup (32 g) regular cocoa powder (not Dutch process)
1 tsp (3 g) baking soda
¬Ω tsp (2 g) baking powder
¬º tsp (1 g) salt
1 ¬Ω cup (375 g) buttermilk, at room temperature
1 ¬Ω (22 ml) Tbsp white vinegar
1 tsp red food colouring paste (preferred over liquid colour)*

Ingredients for Frosting

1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 ¬Ω pkg (12-oz or 340 g)) cream cheese, at room temperature
4 cup (520 g) icing sugar, sifted
1 ¬Ω tsp (7 ml) vanilla extract

Directions - Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 350¬∫F (175 C). Grease two 8-inch square pans and line the pans with parchment so that it comes up the sides as well.

2. Using electric beaters or in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter until smooth, then add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and beating well after each addition, beat in the vanilla.

3. In a separate bowl, sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add this alternately with the buttermilk, starting and ending with the flour. Stir the white vinegar and food colour together and add this to the cake batter on low speed, but mixing until blended in. Scrape the batter into the prepared pans and spread to level.

4. Bake the cakes for about 35 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their pans for 20 minutes, then turn them out to cool completely.

Frosting

1. For the frosting, beat the butter until fluffy, then beat in the cream cheese until well blended and smooth. Add the icing sugar in 2 additions, beating first on low speed and then increasing. Beat in the vanilla.

2. To assemble the cake, place the first layer of cake on your platter or plate and spread a generous amount of frosting on the top. Top this with the second cake layer and frost the top and then the sides. Use your spatula to create any swirls or patterns you wish, then chill for at least 2 hours before slicing to serve.

Ingredients 

¬Ω cup (115 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
¬Ω cup (100 g) packed light brown sugar
¬Ω cup (100 g) granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 ¬º cup (185 g) all-purpose flour

‚Äö√¥¬∞About This Video‚Äö√¥¬∞
Today I am grabbing all of my favorite Dollar Tree blanks and turning them into fall home decor! I am SO excited for fall decorating and diying. I paired Dollar Tree blanks with other crafting supplies I had in my stash, like the new Chalk Couture autumn collection! They had so many fun new transfers that I just had to use! I personally love pairing my Chalk Couture transfers with my Dollar Tree blanks because it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s super easy, takes less time to finish projects, and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to spend hours designing. 
If you love using Dollar Tree blanks as much as I do, you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re going to love these fall diys!

_u9XUW-xlAE,2023-07-10T18:47:30Z,Pets & Animals,"She cry all the time, she can't stand up because heartless people did to her head. Heartbreaking!

2 days ago this little one was hit in head. A young boy has seen a stopped car near, could be by the man from that car with the foot in the head, because hasn't no others injuries over his body and for sure would be not alive if it by a car.
Because everything was closed during the holidays, just today I was with her at the clinic for investigations and treatments.
Of course the vet had the same opinion;that it was rather hit directly in the head and that his locomotory nervous system was affected...she cry all the time because she can't stand up.
Now she will rest hospitalized in the clinic for special care and treatments...we hope she will pass over these days and she will be recover in totally.

There are two options, he was either left by his mother, because he got stuck in the trash and couldn't follow her OR he was thrown away like garbage by people...

Upon learning this, we immediately rushed to the rescue... and after a full day of travelling and searching, we were so happy to have found him!

FW-IMI7TTRU,2012-07-02T18:12:14Z,Pets & Animals,"Animal Advocates Society of BC rescued that old chained dog one dark, cold night on the day we were told about her. We made the video in the hope that it would encourage others to rescue a yard dog. Many distraught people have told us that it did give them the courage to remove a dog from its misery and give it a loving home. 

Ten years on a chain, no blanket, not toy, not even a bone. Often no food or water. Animal Advocates Society of BC first saw this abused and neglected dog at night, lying in the frozen mud in her own feces, being snowed and sleeted on. Neighbours said that her owners urinated on her from the porch. Several upset neighbours told AAS that they had phoned the British Columbia SPCA many times, for many years.

The BC SPCA did not charge the owner with cruelty so Judith's owners were never charged with cruelty.  The BC SPCA did not help her in any way.

Finally Animal Advocates of BC was contacted by a distraught neighbour. We went straight to her; documented her misery and then rescued her out of her indignity and loneliness.

Please donate so we can continue to rescue dogs like ""Judith"". http://www.animaladvocates.com/donate/

When we got her she was emaciated, dehydrated, and barely able to walk because of painful hips. Her coat was weighed down by clumps of caked mud. Her owners had named her ""Judas"". We changed her name to Judith.

We cannot tell you this story without also telling you the happy ending that AAS guarantees every one of the dogs it rescues...
We found her a home with two very special people, who loved her dearly, and made her a member of their family, which is what every dog wants more than anything ‚Äî wants more than food, water and shelter. And when her old hips gave out, her family got her a cart and took her everywhere. She went camping, and to the lake where she went out in the water as far as she was allowed.  She even chased squirrels in her cart. And when she died of old age, after eighteen months, she took with her all her memories of pure love, and warmth, and good food, and fun. And the time before didn't count at all.

A Tiger Begged Soldiers for Help. When they Realized the Reason, they were Speechless

What would you do if a full-grown tiger showed up at your military base? That was the question facing a group of soldiers in India, who were baffled by the tiger's daily visits to their gates. Was it hungry? Was it trying to infiltrate their base? Fear grew among the soldiers until their commander decided to seek help from a zoologist. What the zoologist discovered was surprising - the tiger was not a threat but was trying to communicate something important. And so, a group of soldiers embarked on a perilous mission into the jungle, following the tiger's lead. What they discovered was both shocking and heartwarming. Watch the video to find out how this incredible story of human-animal interaction unfolds.

*UPDATE* Simba and Bella were eventually introduced to each other in June 2015 and now these two once-lonely lions have each other for company.  Simba has had a vasectomy and Bella has a contraceptive implant (as we do not want another generation of lions born into captivity).  We also need to keep space in our precious sanctuary so that more big cats are able to be rescued.

8Z37e4nob2o,2023-07-24T20:52:51Z,News & Politics,"Tim Ballard, the real-life subject of the new movie ""Sound of Freedom,"" is stunned by the $125 million the film has already brought in at the box office. The former government agent who left his job to rescue children from human trafficking told CBN's Faithwire no one anticipated the movie would attract so much attention and do so well. 

""I think we live in a time where ... children are being forgotten,"" Ballard said, noting he believes adult content is being pushed on kids, including transgender ideology. ""Kids are extremely vulnerable right now."" With consent laws being bent and changed to accommodate the transgender issue, he said he's concerned about the impact these dynamics could have on the sexualization of kids. 

""Kids are under attack,"" Ballard said. ""Kids are being hurt in a lot of ways. I think people feel it. I think there's a spiritual warfare context to some of this stuff and people feel that too."" Ballard believes ""Sound of Freedom"" exposes evil and brings many of these issues to the surface, attracting attention to the importance of fighting human trafficking. As for those dismissing the movie as being ""QAnon-adjacent"" and offering other such critiques, Ballard said these media outlets and individuals are lying.

""These people coming out against the film ... they're lying about it and they know they are,"" he said. ""Anyone who watches the film knows there's nothing QAnonish or 'QAnon-adjacent.'"" Explaining how ""Sound of Freedom"" sat for years before finding a home with Angel Studios, Ballard said the movie was made well before anyone was widely coining or using the QAnon title. Watch him explain how Disney reportedly shelved the movie and his hopes for how it can help save people from the horrors of trafficking.

A local group rescued Brutus from a home in north Tulsa. A family in southeastern Oklahoma later adopted him. The family that adopted Brutus has a boy with a seizure disorder and they realized Brutus could sense when the boy was about to have a seizure. The rescue group said they knew Brutus was special, but until he helped save a life they didn't how special he was. The Hawkins family told FOX23 that Brutus would always alert them when the boy was having a seizure so they could make sure the boy was ok.

N7C1jaOY5co,2011-07-25T23:33:54Z,Pets & Animals,"July 2021 marks the 10-year anniversary of Prince's arrival at PAWS' 2,300-acre ARK 2000 sanctuary in Northern California. The feature article in our July 2021 newsletter is a tribute to this wonderful elephant. You can read it here: https://conta.cc/374pepY

* * * * * * * * * * *

Prince is an Asian bull elephant now living at the Performing Animal Welfare Society's (PAWS) 2,300-acre ARK 2000 captive wildlife sanctuary in Northern California. He arrived at PAWS on July 21, 2011, and is now a neighbor to Nicholas, another Asian bull elephant.

Prince is a retired circus elephant donated voluntarily to PAWS, at its request, by Feld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey. He was born on May 24, 1987, at the Portland Zoo as part of their captive breeding program, and sold to the circus. Prince's mother was Me-tu, also born at Portland Zoo; his father was Hugo.

You are viewing  a video that was taken in 2011 on the day after Prince arrived at ARK 2000. It shows his barn and the small outdoor yard that leads to his big habitat which cannot be seen in this video. (We added music to this video because the wind was blowing so hard that day that all you could hear on the video was what sounded like a freight train. No nature sounds, no elephant sounds and unbearable to listen to. But it was Prince's first day out, so we added the music rather than scrapping the video.)

After slowly introducing him to his new home, and allowing him to get used to these unfamiliar surroundings, Prince was finally introduced to the large habitat. He now has 24/7 access to his barn, small yard and large outdoor habitat at our sanctuary. His outdoor habitat consists of acres of rolling hills with majestic oak and pine trees, grass and two pools. One pool is on a hill near his barn, the other is on the back side of his habitat. He can usually be found napping on the side of a hill.

THIS VIDEO:
Prince stayed inside his barn on the night of his arrival at PAWS' ARK 2000. This allowed him to relax and adapt to his new surroundings. After walking about, eating and drinking and inspecting everything, he laid down on a mound of dirt and fell asleep.

The next morning Prince was ready to take his first steps outside. PAWS' co-founders Ed Stewart and the late Pat Derby coaxed him out of his barn by tossing treats in front of him (bananas seemed to be his favorite). He moved about cautiously, ate grass, drank water, looked at the pool, but did not go in at first. He did come back to the pool later in the morning and went for his first swim.

To ensure that all animals living at PAWS have the most natural, intrusion-free lives possible, our sanctuaries are not open to the public, with the exception of a limited number of educational events at ARK 2000. Visit our calendar of events page on our website to learn more.

PAWS does not breed, sell, or rent its animals or make them perform. 

The Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) was formed in 1984 to rescue and care for abused, neglected or retired exotic and wild animals. PAWS operates three sanctuaries in California, and cares for elephants, big cats, bears, and other wild and exotic species. PAWS actively advocates on behalf of captive wildlife, and educates the public about issues affecting these animals in captivity and in the wild. PAWS established the first elephant sanctuary in the U.S. in 1986. Since then, 19 elephants have found refuge at the sanctuary.

PAWS advocates for an end to the suffering of captive wild animals through legislation and education and was integral to the passage of milestone legislation in California, including:  establishing greater protections for captive elephants and other wildlife; prohibiting up-close, canned hunts of wild animals;  and ending the use of cruel elephant bullhooks in Los Angeles and Oakland, and then the entire state of California. PAWS‚Äô legislative activity extends outside of California, including ending the use of elephant bullhooks in the state of Rhode Island and various U.S. cities, and providing expert support for captive wildlife protection bills.

vtrcrrEG-5g,2017-08-01T15:08:09Z,News & Politics,"CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Five young children, all related, were adopted on Thursday by their foster parents.

‚ÄúNo way were we going to split them up.‚Äù

That was the message from a foster mom and dad who are no longer foster parents. Now they're just parents.

Every court case has a number, but behind every number there is a person, or in this case, five.

Five children, the oldest age 12, the youngest age 2, were all adopted by their foster parents.

‚ÄúWe can't separate them, it's about the kids,‚Äù said Wil Rom, who is now the father of the five kids.

The kids, 12-year-old William, 9-year-old Truth, 6-year-old Mariana, 3-year-old Keyora, and 2-year-old KJ are all siblings or half siblings with the same mom.

Wil and Julie Rom took the youngsters in as foster children between 2014 and 2016 and then decided to adopt them all at once.

‚ÄúThere was never a second guess. It was a package, a package deal,‚Äù said Wil.

Judge Ralph Winkler presided in the creation of one big happy family.

‚ÄúThe kids would miss each other if we had to separate them and most of the time they do get separated, which is a sad thing for the children. But these kids get to stay together forever,‚Äù said Judge Ralph Winkler.

‚ÄúWe went from a three-bedroom ranch to a five-bedroom two-story. But it's for the kids. It's best to keep them together,‚Äù said Julie.

Others sharing the joy on Thursday were friends, family and even a former teacher of the two oldest kids.

‚ÄúI look at these two boys right now and they are alive right now. Their eyes are bright with wonder. I could not be more grateful to Julie for letting former teachers in who have a piece of their heart in these children, to let them know that they're okay and I‚Äôm grateful to you for letting me be here for this process,‚Äù said Ann Boyle, a former teacher of the kids.

A lot of the time, people who are in a courtroom are either unhappy, in handcuffs, or both. That was definitely not the case on Thursday.

Court is adjourned. The family is in session.",,vtrcrrEG-5g,2,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtrcrrEG-5g/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLCjrdzcMJnssv4YCw6wgUcwbrkIUg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtrcrrEG-5g,"""No way were we going to split them up"": Local foster parents adopt 5 siblings",LOCAL 12,173,3929736,WKK4p-wH7Ms,31/07/2023 11:27,"['Jaw', 'Ear']","['ADOPTION', 'CEREMONY', 'DET', 'LAGI', 'LAGNE', 'BLA', 'LOCAL', '(', '2']",24,11,11,2,2,2,2,3,2190

 Thank you so much for watching this week's video! this video has been in the works for several months and i'm so glad it's finally done üòÆ‚Äçüí® if you watched my 2021 room makeover you'll see how different my style  has become, and honestly i love having a more colorful and cozy room rather than minimal because i am most definitely a maximalist. if you're wondering where i got a certain item i showed, feel free to ask in the comment, and i will try my best to get you the link! (please include a timestamp!) i love you guys so much, see you in my next video ü´∂

The Cotswolds is a region known for its picturesque English villages and rolling hills. On our three-day adventure, we explore the rich history, indulge in local cuisine, and find unique and interesting places to see in the Cotswolds. From the charming village of Painswick, known as the ""queen of the Cotswolds,"" to the idyllic Arlington Row in Bibury, often considered the prettiest village in the Cotswolds, to the quaint streets of Chipping Camden and Castle Combe. We had a wonderful time exploring so many of the unique English villages the Cotswolds is known for and can't wait to visit again.

The full sturgeon moon will blaze across the sky tonight just one month after we saw the Buck Moon. The Sturgeon Moon will represent the midpoint in four major moon-related events this summer.

Moon lovers won't have to wait long for another supermoon after tonight as the Full Blue Moon will fall on August 30. The term 'sturgeon moon' originates from North America and is the common nickname given to the full moon in August - it stems from the increase in sturgeon fish in North American lakes at this time of year.

While the tournament's allure extends beyond the court, attracting star-studded attendees including esteemed members of the Royal Family, there was one incident that left Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, dissatisfied with the management. The Duchess of Kent and Wimbledon ‚Äì a complicated relationship

In 1999, she encountered a frustrating situation when her request to bring a bereaved friend's 12-year-old son into the Royal Box was sternly rejected due to strict rules allowing only royal children. Although she was offered alternative seating, the incident left her deeply hurt.

Despite her disappointment, Katharine handled the situation with grace and respect, choosing not to boycott the Royal Box. She continued to present trophies alongside her husband, Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, until 2001. Recently, the reclusive Duchess made a rare public appearance, providing heartfelt insights into her memorable embrace with the late tennis legend Jana Novotna in 1993. 

In a 2018 interview, she candidly discussed her encounters with various stars, including a light-hearted incident involving Bear Grylls, showcasing that even royalty can't resist the temptation of a selfie.

8. Tilt down from mosques to protest 
9. Wide of protest 
STORYLINE:

Thousands of people took to the streets Friday in the Lebanon‚Äôs capital to express their outrage at the desecration of a copy of the Quran in Sweden, a day after protesters stormed the country's embassy in Iraq.

In the southern suburbs of Beirut, protesters gathered at a rally called by the Iran-backed militia and political party Hezbollah, also brandishing copies of the holy book and chanting ‚Äúwith our blood, we protect the Quran.‚Äù Some burned Swedish flags. 

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a video address Thursday night called on Muslims to demand their governments expel Sweden‚Äôs ambassadors. Iraq cut diplomatic ties with Sweden earlier that day.

The demonstrations came after Swedish police permitted a protest Thursday in which an Iraqi of Christian origin ‚Äî now a self-described atheist ‚Äî living in Stockholm kicked and stood on a Quran, Islam's holy book, outside of the Iraqi Embassy. 

The right to hold public demonstrations is protected by the constitution in Sweden. 

Blasphemy laws were abandoned in the 1970s. Police generally give permission based on whether they believe a public gathering can be held without major disruptions or safety risks. 

However, for Muslims, burning or other abuse of the Quran represents a desecration of their religion‚Äôs holy text. 

Thursday's Quran desecration was the second to involve the Iraqi man in Sweden, identified as Salwan Momika. 

The burning sparked protests in other Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq and Iran.  

Last month, a man identified by local media and on his social media as Momika burned a Quran outside a Stockholm mosque during the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, triggering widespread condemnation in the Islamic world.

Quran burnings in the past have sparked protests across the Muslim world, some turning violent. In Afghanistan, the Taliban suspended all the activities of Swedish organizations in the country in response to the recent Quran burning.

MURFREESBORO, Tenn.--A Rutherford county K-9 officer suffered injuries this weekend, during a manhunt. The Murfreesboro dog's life was saved thanks to another four-legged friend. Sergeant Lee Young trains K-9 units for the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office. After retiring his former K-9 named Arak, he got three-year-old, Buddy. Sgt. Lee Young said, He is like my child. I spend more time with him than I do my wife and kids. Sgt. Young and Ely spent more time together on Sunday. They were searching for one of two suspects involved in a shooting, with two guns and an ax. Sgt. Young says he gave Ely plenty of water before and during the manhunt, but after running several hundred yards Ely was dehydrated. Sgt. Lee Young explained   He was heat exhausted. We started back and he collapsed his legs started to get wobbly  . We made it back to where we crossed the fence, and at that time he fell out. Ely was cooled down on-scene by paramedics and law enforcement. He was then taken to Williams Animal Hospital. I actually thought he wasn't going to make it.  And I don't think the vets or the techs did either, said Sgt. Young. Ely's blood platelet levels were so low, he received a blood transfusion. He is improving each day according to the hospital staff. With Ely coming up on his second year with Rutherford County law enforcement, he can continue to help others because someone else helped him. Five-year-old, Buddy is a shepherd mix. The hospital took blood from Buddy as a last resort to to save Ely. Buddy is up for adoption and now the hospital staff hopes someone will rescue Buddy. Williams Animal Hospital technician, Katie Love said, He's been our little hero around here and we just want him to go to a good home.Sgt. Young said,  He's a great dog, he is good and friendly. It takes everybody.Williams Animal Hospital says Buddy is a very friendly dog, and gets along well with cats. Buddy will not do well in a home with small dogs, though. If you are interested in adopting Buddy, contact Williams Animal Hospital in Murfreesboro at 198 Chaffin Place,  Murfreesboro, TN 37129(615) 895-0650.The Rutherford County Sheriff's office is also getting cooling vests for its K-9 units.

Two years ago, Tamara O‚ÄôBrien was a 21-year-old gymnast on the Canadian National Team and had just earned a medal at the World Games. She was on her way to the World Championships when she discovered a lump on the left side of her neck. It was this lump that would turn O‚ÄôBrien ‚Äî the rising star athlete she always saw herself as ‚Äî into a new person, someone she would have to get to know all over again. #documentaryChannel #Before&amp;After

Her diagnosis became a pivotal moment for O‚ÄôBrien that would change her priorities and her perspective. On the anniversary of her diagnosis, she shares her vulnerable and intimate story in Before &amp; After: Cancer Diagnosis.

i7F-7BggUx0,2021-11-10T20:23:16Z,News & Politics,"Dale Edge never talked about the war but always wondered what happened to that wounded vet he helped save that awful day in Vietnam.

STORY: https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/making-a-difference/illinois-vietnam-war-vet-reunites-man-he-saved-battlefield-50-years-ago/63-62d9f348-9606-430f-a2bf-7f9248bded1a

There is never an easy route to the places that matter.

And on this day, two men are going in a new direction.

The destination is Ashland, Illinois, a farming community about 120 miles and decibels from St. Louis. 

""I've always liked farming because it's you're your own boss,"" said Dale Edge.

Edge lives and works on 400 acres. He's been farming this land practically all his life except for the time when he traded in his work boots for army boots.

The year was 1968, and Dale Edge was drafted to fight for his country in Vietnam.

""I knew probably it was a good likelihood I would get drafted. I wasn't going to volunteer, but I wasn't going to run either,"" he said.

But the Vietnam War was like a wound that never healed. Soldiers bravely faced the enemy only to come home and face scorn as soon as their plane landed. 

""There's guys kissing the ground, glad to be back, glad to have made it,"" he said. ""Then, another 30 feet from where they were doing that, people behind a fence started screaming and hollering and stuff that I ain't going to repeat it.""

That's why Edge took his feelings and his stories and buried them. Except for one.

One story that needed an ending.

And recently, after getting his first smartphone, he finally decided to solve the mystery by doing some checking on the internet. Then, he got up the courage to make a phone call.

Fred Kjorlien answered.

""I said, 'Dale I got to be really honest, I don't know who you are.' He said, 'It's been 53 years so I can understand that.'""

Kjorlien lives in Minnesota and works for Great Steps, a company that makes prosthetic and orthotic devices. And he's pretty popular with his clients.

""They like people that are amputees because you can feel some of the stuff,"" he said. "" And some people think 'Oh you got one, then I'm OK.'""

Kjorlien lost his leg during a firefight in Vietnam.

""I got behind a tree dropped down and this leg was up and I was shooting,"" he said. ""And an RPG hit the side of the tree.""

Edge remembers that attack.

""Before the medics got there, I put a tourniquet on Fred's leg,"" he told us. 

And then he remembers keeping Fred calm and helping to get him on a medical evacuation chopper.

""He said, 'I'm going to beat you home,'"" Edge recalled. ""I said, 'I'll never forget that Fred.' And I didn't.""

They were in the same platoon but didn't know each other that well before that day. Still, for more than half a century, Dale Edge wondered.

""I didn't know if he lived. I wanted to know if he made it or not,"" said Edge.

Thanks to one phone call, his empty feeling was now filled.

And then his heart was filled, when Fred drove more than 560 miles for a reunion more than 50 years in the making.

So much time and distance meant so little as soon as the two men started talking. They would spend the weekend excavating memories.

""It was an answer to a prayer if you want to know the truth,"" Edge said. ""I don't know how many times I prayed for that man.""

Remembering the hard days is always easier with an old friend.

For the first time since they've been back from Vietnam, these two veterans finally get a welcome home.

""It means a lot because I love him,"" said a teary-eyed Kjorlien.","['local', 'making-a-difference', 'news', 'vietnam war', 'local news', 'veterans day', '1968', 'Ashland', 'Illinois', 'ASHLAND ILLINOIS', 'veterans reunited', 'veterans reunited with each other', 'veterans reunion', 'veterans reunited after years', 'vets reunited', 'veterans', 'vets', 'heartwarming', 'good news', 'vietnam veteran', 'boyd huppert', 'happy news', 'heartwarming stories']",i7F-7BggUx0,2,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i7F-7BggUx0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLCIFiCTK9fzws2DrIQFFjQR0z2UZA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7F-7BggUx0,Vietnam War veteran reunites with man he saved on battlefield 50 years ago,KSDK News,300,4312714,BNJeeG5FA-Y,01/08/2023 21:14,"['Plant', 'Tree', 'Gesture']","['VIETNAM', 'VET', 'REUNITES', 'WITH', 'MAN', 'HE', 'SAVED', 'SONYOUR', 'SIDE']",160,156,161,2,2,4,2,2,629

People informed as that she lived for too many years as a stray .. Today she is too elderly to take care of herself.  Thankfully she will have the care and the safety she needs and of course I will be by her side. 
We wanted to give her a bath but she was too stressed so we will do it in a couple of days .
She had a health check and deworming . 
Everything will be fine now .

He traveled the globe as a leading animal conservationist promoting Columbus. It was his home for decades.

But at age 76, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease has stripped away his memory and the life he led in the public eye for almost a half century. He was first diagnosed in the fall of 2019 with early Alzheimer's but now the disease has advanced to the point where he doesn't know most of his own family.

Reyes died after being shot by a Colorado Police Officer.

5 years later Sam‚Äôs squad car was to be auctioned off on to benefit C.O.P.S (Concerns of Police Survivors), an organization that helps survivors of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.

Tanner Brownlee wanted to own a part of his father's legacy, and after nearly five years since losing him, Tanner had a chance to buy his dad's squad car at auction.

Unfortunately, Tanner had not planned on the bid for the car being so high, and the bidding price quickly surpassed what he could afford. The young man's hopes were crushed when local farmer Steve Wells outbid Tanner, paying $60,000, even though the car's Kelley Blue Book value was only $12,500.

But seconds after the auctioneer handed Wells the keys to the squad car, the farmer turned to face Tanner, ""Tanner? Here's your car,"" said Wells as he handed the young man the keys.

The entire room erupted in applause as an emotional Tanner accepted Wells' gift, thanking and hugging him for his incredible generosity.

Originally Steve was going to buy the car for the Women‚Äôs Shelter, and then he found out about Tanner‚Äôs story and he decided to buy it for him, even though the two had never previously met.

The man who won the bid was Steve Wells, a local rancher who owns several acres of oil-rich land in the area. He declined an interview, saying he did not want to take the moment away from Tanner and his family.

Tanner said he plans to keep the car forever, and to one day, hand it down to his kids.

Thanks for watching

We named her Rea .
‚óèShe survived  3 days in the water in  an irrigation canal  . No rest , no sleep,  no food .
‚óèShe survived by shots. 
‚óèShe survived by a hit , as she had a broken pelvis .
‚óèShe survived by million of maggots eating her flesh 
She survived!!!! 
She stayed under our care for months under lots of treatments, she was also positive in  Mediterranean disease. 
For each one of our rescued animal our goal is an adoption..For Rea , having so many issues we thought that this   wouldn't be easy and then Sarah  Bagsaw came in ... 
Rea today  is adopted, happy and in very good health . We would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who helped her find happiness ,(Hayley, G.A.R., Andrew )  but most of all Sarah who believed in her since the first moment she saw her .
Rea is a great dog and she so deserved a good life ... We couldn't be happier for her .

I decided to make a music video to the song 'Rude' by Magic and screen it in a cinema after the trailers while we were on a seemingly normal date with her sister and brother-in-law. I snuck out to 'go to the bathroom' and you'll have to watch what happens next! 

A huge shoutout to Magic! for the video message at the end, hope you don't mind what we've done with the song!

World's Funniest Flight Attendant Leaves Passengers In Hysterics

Subscribe to Caters Clips: http://bit.ly/CatersClipsSubscribe 

A man has been dubbed the ‚Äòworld‚Äôs funniest‚Äô flight attendant after a viral video shows him leaving 150 passengers in stitches with his snarky safety announcement.

Cindy Kuhn, 55, captured the hilarious moment a flight attendant took to the plane's tannoy to read out his hilarious, unique take on a safety announcement.

Rows of passengers are heard in the video laughing hysterically as the flight attendant put his witty spin on what are normally passenger safety instructions before take-off.

Frontier Airlines flight attendant, Daniel Sandberg, started his announcement by introducing the flight attendant at the front of the plane as his wife and the one in the back as his mistress ‚Äì before taking off on his three-minute comedy routine.

There are quiet moms, and there are loud Moms. If you‚Äôre coming home after being deployed overseas for way too long, and you‚Äôve got one of those loud Moms‚Ä¶Do your neighbors a favor and close the windows before you surprise her.

There‚Äôs a moment when you see that special someone that‚Äôs been away for too long, where everything else in the world simply doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, and you‚Äôre filled with pure joy at the very sight of them. This is one of those beautiful moments.

There may be no more of a striking figure than a Marine in his dress blues. The only thing more moving is when that Marine is your son back from boot camp to tell his Dad, I made it. I‚Äôm a Marine now. I did it pop. I did it for you.

Our boy Luke here is about to go on a roller coaster of emotions with this next reunion. He‚Äôs about to go from ‚ÄúOh no, why is there a cop asking to see my bag?‚Äù to ‚Äúheartwarming surprise‚Äù almost in an instant. Let‚Äôs watch it play out.

Brothers and their little Sisters have a special, unique, and unbreakable bond. We‚Äôre about to see that on full display as big bro decides to drop in unexpectedly to see his little sister after returning from a long deployment.

This next one gets extra points for the use of a well placed teddy bear when we witness the touching return of a Husband to his Wife after a separation of a year and a half. Imagine being apart from your spouse for that long. What would that hug feel like? Pretty good, I‚Äôd imagine.

As far as these reunions go, they come in 2 varieties‚Ä¶Public and private. Here we see the surprise reunion taking center stage during a performance in front of a raucous crowd only too willing to cheer on their comrade as he embraces his Wife and 5 children after finally returning home.

In this touching moment, this Military veteran and Father to a current soldier isn‚Äôt going to let his illness or that wheelchair stop him from standing at attention and saluting his Son upon hisreturn from active duty.
\
Sometimes the surprise return of your loved one from deployment will result in the Mom, Wife,kids, or what have you.. having to go through a few   before they actually accept what‚Äôsreally happening. The first stage is  always disbelief. Here‚Äôs a great example.

286 days of deployment and separation from his Grandma are about to be over in an instant.That old gal is about to be smiling from ear to ear with the whole family there to celebrate with her.

Let‚Äôs not forget the 4 legged family members left behind when their owners go overseas. What do you think the chances are that Murphy the dog here is going to be able to contain himself when finally reunited with his long lost best friend? See for yourself.

This one is guaranteed to have you reaching for the kleenex when what this girl thought was just another day at work quickly turns into a day she‚Äôll never forget when her brother shows up to surprise her ahead of her graduation day.

There may be no greater love shared than that between a Father and his son. Here we get to join in and see that love explode with a mighty bear hug when a Father gets to wrap his arms around his hero son finally back safely after putting himself in danger to protect his country.

If your son or daughter is in the Navy, long separations while they‚Äôre out at sea are something you will have to accept. Although acceptance is one thing, getting used to it is another. So when they magically pop up while you‚Äôre out enjoying a meal, that‚Äôs going to result in instant tears of joy.

No matter how long your Dad is away serving in God knows what part of the world, one thing a young boy will never forget, is the sound of his voice.

This emotional and touching reunion is brought to us with the help of the Boston Bruins professional Hockey team setting the stage for this young boy to leap into his Father‚Äôs waiting arms after what must have seemed like forever.

Hey Grandma‚Ä¶I hope you baked enough cookies. You‚Äôre going to need them because your Grandson‚Äôs going to be very hungry after being at sea serving in the Navy for all that time. That is, if that hug will ever end.

Coming off the field after a football game‚Ä¶you may not be the most aware of your surroundings. Which means you might have to look twice or maybe even 3 times to make sure if that‚Äôs your Dad or not just standing there in the locker room. But when it hits, it hits hard.

Thank you for coming along with us on the rollercoaster of emotions that these reunions naturally are. And thank you to the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their families for being gracious enough to share their most intimate moments with us so we can all honor their sacrifice and delight in the love they share together.

My husband Gus has raised my daughter Alexa since she was 2 1/2. After she lost her own father to gun violence in the streets of Philadelphia just a week shy of her first birthday. After 10 years of being her Dad in every way she finally asks him to make it official in this Fathers Day surprise video. Something he‚Äôs always wanted to do but wanted to wait until it was her decision. He had no idea and was totally shocked! 

We have a son together, Noah, and we used him in the surprise. I told him the kids picked out their gifts for him on their own this year and each gift was personal. From kid to Dad. 

We made him a picture book of just him and Alexa. Starting with the very first picture they ever took. And on the last page there‚Äôs a pic of just her holding a sign saying ‚ÄúHey Dad! 10 years seems long enough don‚Äôt ya think?! Wanna adopt me?‚Äù

The best Adoption surprise compilation that will melt your heart | All Things Internet

Adoption is more than a legal process; it is the most wonderful life changing thing any child or teenager could go through! 

No two adoption stories are the same, every child deserves a fighting chance and we applauded every individual that has ever adopted a child and given him or her a life that they would never have had and a sense of truly belonging to a family. 

These stories will melt your heart!

As the sun began to set on a chilly evening, the owner of a popular chain of restaurants donned his oldest, most tattered clothes and set out into the streets. Disguised as a homeless person, he made his way to one of his own restaurants, determined to see firsthand how his employees treated those less fortunate. Little did they know, he was on a mission to determine which of his heirs would inherit the family business.So he decided to conduct a test and discovered something unexpected.

WUtoevhiQaU,2020-01-30T19:24:10Z,People & Blogs,"This was one of the sweetest moments we have ever captured between a bride and groom. Karli surprised her husband, Ty, with EnChroma glasses right after their first look, and his reaction to seeing color for the first time is indescribable. This moment reminded us how easily we can take for granted something as simple as seeing colors properly. 

So take a minute to enjoy watching this beautiful interaction, be prepared to cry a little bit, and excuse our shaky cameras as we were too emotional to keep ourselves composed.

Unbeknownst to bride and groom Rachel and Shane McNally, friend Hannah O‚ÄôBrien had been hard at work training friends and family (from both sides) to sing together in beautiful harmony at the ceremony on August 3. Even the bride‚Äôs father joined the performance.

Wedding videographer Ray Yore captured this video of the performance as it unfolded in St Joseph‚Äôs Church, Carrickmacross. He told Storyful that he‚Äôd been told it would happen at some point in the ceremony, but he didn‚Äôt know when.

‚ÄúIt was an awesome surprise and moved everyone to tears,‚Äù he said, adding that ‚Äúit was a beautiful tribute to the bride and groom.‚Äù

‚ÄúStand by Me‚Äù was first recorded in 1960 by Ben E. King, who wrote it with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.

‚úÖ‚úÖ Develop your dog's hidden intelligence to eliminate bad behavior and get a smarter dog.
‚ûú ‚ûú https://tinyurl.com/thecagdotyt ‚úÖ‚úÖ
___________________________________________
To Be Clear: German Shepherds are intelligent, sociable, and energetic dogs that need a lot of affection, stimulation, and care to remain healthy and happy. These dogs' emotional well-being and behavior can suffer as a result of specific events and circumstances, though. In this video, we'll look at 8 things that might emotionally hurt German Shepherds. In order to provide these dogs the care they require to thrive, it is essential to understand what can emotionally hurt them. Let‚Äôs Get Started.




Number 1: Sudden disappearance of a trusted person or companion animal.
German Shepherds may experience emotional trauma when a dependable person or pet suddenly disappears. These dogs are extremely social animals that develop close relationships with their human families and other animals. German Shepherds may suffer a sense of sorrow, perplexity, and abandonment when a beloved family member or pet abruptly departs from their lives. Depression, separation anxiety, and other behavioral problems may emerge from this.
Number 2: Change of routine or environment.
For German Shepherds, a change in routine or environment might be upsetting. Because these dogs thrive on predictability and consistency, abrupt changes may make them feel uneasy and confused. Negative behaviors like barking, chewing, or even hostility may result from this. German Shepherds can adjust to changes more easily if they are introduced gradually and given lots of affection, care, and confidence. They can get used to their new environment if you create a new routine and give them plenty of mental and physical stimulation. Keeping familiar toys or objects in their new setting might also provide them a sense of security and comfort.
Number 3: Unpredictable or inconsistent behavior from their human family.
German Shepherds may become confused and emotionally disturbed by their human family members' inconsistent or unpredictable conduct. Because these dogs depend on their human family for direction and structure, they can get uneasy and uncomfortable when their behavior is erratic or unpredictable. Anxiety, fear, and behavioral issues like violence or destructive conduct might result from this. German Shepherds may develop trust with their human families and learn what is expected of them with consistent training and good reinforcement. German Shepherds can behave well when kept in a steady, predictable setting with defined rules and boundaries. This can give them a sense of security and self-confidence.
Number 4: Ignoring or neglecting them.
A German Shepherd can suffer major emotional repercussions from being neglected or ignored. These dogs are very social creatures who enjoy receiving love and attention from their human families. They may experience feelings of despair, depression, and anxiety when they are ignored or neglected because they may come to believe that they are unloved, unimportant, and undesired. German Shepherds can become destructive or exhibit behavioral issues when left alone for extended periods of time without the right mental and physical activity. It's critical to give German Shepherds the love and care they require because neglecting them can have a long-term negative impact on their health and behavior.
Number 5: Lack of socialization or interaction with other dogs or people.
The emotional health of German Shepherds might suffer from a lack of socialization or interaction with other animals or people. These dogs are extremely sociable and want for companionship with both their human family and other canines. Lack of social interaction can make them lonely, bored, and worried, which can result in aggressive or harmful conduct. German Shepherds can benefit from regular mental and physical activity, socializing with other dogs and people, and other forms of stimulation.
Number 6: Physical or medical neglect.
Neglecting to provide German Shepherds with veterinary treatment, for example, can have substantial and long-lasting effects on their emotional and physical health. German Shepherds can become afraid, anxious, and aggressive when they are in pain or have a medical issue. Neglecting a dog's medical needs can result in serious, potentially fatal conditions as well as a great deal of emotional pain for the animal. Regular veterinary examinations, vaccines, and early medical attention are essential for maintaining the physical and mental health of German Shepherds.

By focusing on the acts of kindness, we can shift our perspective and see the other side of the world. It may seem like the world is more cruel if we solely pay attention to negativity, but this video is here to remind us of the beauty and faith in humanity that still exists.

Now, this church, my friends, has a rather unique visitor‚Äîa visitor who's not human at all. Can you guess who it is? Well, it's none other than a lovable dog! Now, before you start thinking, ""Wait a minute, a dog in a church? Isn't that a bit unusual? "" Don't worry, my curious friends, because this tale gets even more intriguing. You see, this four-legged friend wasn't just any ordinary churchgoer. No, no, no. This dog would arrive all by himself, without an owner in sight.

#NAME?,2023-08-01T19:00:00Z,News & Politics,"In the bustling streets of the city, where time hurriedly moved forward, an unforeseen encounter unfolded within the walls of a quaint restaurant. Little did the manager know that this seemingly ordinary day would bring a lesson in humility and compassion that would forever alter the course of his life.

As the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting its warm glow upon the streets, an old woman appeared at the entrance of the establishment. Clad in tattered clothes and bearing the marks of a life full of hardships, she looked like a beggar seeking respite from the world's callousness.

The restaurant manager, engrossed in the demands of his profession, saw her through a lens clouded by the incessant rush of the daily grind. Without a second thought, he approached the woman, his tone laden with impatience, and urged her to leave, assuming she was just another intruder.

Unbeknownst to him, the frail figure before him held a story far beyond her appearance. Little did he realize that her presence in his restaurant was no coincidence. She was a harbinger of a poignant reminder - a reminder that life is an ever-changing tapestry of fates interwoven, and the fortunes of one can swiftly mirror the destitution of another.

The old woman, whose identity remained concealed in the shadow of her humble exterior, bore a valuable lesson that transcended social barriers and the veneer of appearances. Life's uncertainties could cast anyone into the abyss of despair, and the same hands that once pushed others away might one day yearn for the warmth of a helping soul.

In the narrative of existence, compassion and empathy stand as beacons of hope, illuminating the darkest of paths and transforming callous hearts. And as the restaurant manager unknowingly closed the door on the enigmatic old woman, he had yet to learn the profound truth that life's wheel turns without pause, and one must embrace the humanity within, for there lies the key to the transformative power of kindness.

Thus, this seemingly ordinary day would unfurl a tale of awakening - a story that would not only change the manager's perception of others but, more importantly, his perception of himself. For in this intricate dance of life, the way we treat others echoes far beyond the present moment, leaving indelible imprints on the very fabric of our shared journey.","['life lessons', 'acts of kindness', 'faith in humanity', 'faith in humanity restored', 'act of kindness', 'kindness', 'caught on camera', 'Restaurant', 'Wonderbot']",#NAME?,20,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-tSYq-H4NPQ/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEjCOgCEMoBSFryq4qpAxUIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJDeAE=&rs=AOn4CLBTLVnEKogfkZ-1AkEH-6qz9uHHtg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tSYq-H4NPQ,"Manager KICKS Old Lady Out of Restaurant, He Lives To Regret It",Wonderbot,363,23044,initial_search,02/08/2023 12:07,"['Photograph', 'Organ', 'Eyelash', 'Jaw', 'Shorts']",[],165,162,137,1,2,4,5,2,1

Hello Everyone! Its Tiffany with Thrifting Vegas. I shop at thrift stores, estate sales, garage sales and discount stores for items I can resell for a profit on online platforms like eBay, Poshmark and Offer-Up.

$9.99 GOODWILL Find LISTED FOR $165 on EBAY / WHAT HAPPENS When I HOLD IT UP to LIGHT? / BUY My HAUL

Its Friday night and we have had record breaking temperatures for the month of July here in Las Vegas. I'm at my favorite Goodwill at Rainbow and Cheyenne, hoping they have restocked the shelves in preparation for the weekend. I have my reuseable shopping bags and Thrifting Vegas blanket, and I'm so excited at how quickly my cart fills up!!! Thrift with me and learn what to bolo and what to leave on the shelf, and why.  Stay to watch my haul where I show you everything I found, what I paid and what I expect to get for it. Please don't forget that you can BUY DIRECTLY from my HAUL. Sometimes I find something I absolutely love, but almost all of the items you see in my haul are for sale.  Please don't wait, I get hundreds of emails a day! If you would like to purchase something, please send me your offer (plus shipping to your zip code) in an email with your mailing address, Paypal email, and a description, timestamp or screenshot of the item you would like to purchase, to ThriftingVegas.Tiffany@gmail.com. 

After the haul, stay to watch BONUS FOOTAGE of my son Jake practicing his Krav Maga kicks, Ziggy and Bear waiting for me to finish my haul so that we can go to bed, and the beautiful hummingbirds in our yard. Our German Shepherd dogs, Bear and Rio, have their own channel, so please subscribe @bearandriolasvegas to enjoy their latest adventures.

ryZLM8KxhDk,2019-06-04T18:00:09Z,News & Politics,"CINCINNATI (WKRC) - A woman collapsed in a Hamilton County courtroom after being sentenced to prison for a car crash.

Michelle Lake pleaded for mercy. While Judge Patrick Dinkelacker said he sympathized, he showed Lake none, calling her a ticking time bomb.

""I'm so very sorry for what happened,‚Äù said Lake during sentencing. ‚ÄúI wish so badly I could take that day back.""

But the 35-year-old mother of three cannot take back the 2018 crash that severely injured two people. It was Thursday, Dec. 6 at about 9:30 a.m., when Lake was driving and crossed the center line, hitting a car driven by Jody Cox.

""I still have issues; I still have pain,‚Äù said Cox during the sentencing. ‚ÄúI still can't walk right. I still have emotional issues. I still see that constantly and it affects me a great deal.""

""I'm so sorry. I'm so very sorry,"" said Lake to Cox.

Another adult passenger and Cox's 2-year-old were in the car. Luckily, the 2-year-old wasn't hurt, but the judge reminded Lake that investigators determined cocaine, fentanyl and methadone were in her system at the time of the crash.

""These demons haunt me every day,‚Äù said Lake. ‚ÄúAnd the night before the accident, these demons took advantage of the weak state of mind I was in. The decisions that followed will haunt me and the victim's family and my family forever.""

But it wasn't necessarily this accident alone on which the prosecutor based his sentencing recommendation of 10 years.

""She's already been to prison twice,‚Äù said the prosecuting attorney. ‚ÄúShe had another crash frighteningly similar to this. Killed a person and only did two years and she did a burglary that she didn't do very long on.""

In the end, Dinkelacker gave the maximum sentence -- 10 years for one count of vehicular assault and one count of aggravated vehicular assault, plus a lifetime driver's license suspension.

As the judge read her sentence, Lake‚Äôs knees buckled and she sobbed as she went to the ground. As she was led from the courtroom to begin her sentence, her husband called after her, saying, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù amidst Lake sobbing, ‚ÄúOh my God; oh my God.‚Äù

In that 2006 crash referenced by the prosecutor, it was Lake's passenger who died. Again, she had only served two years for that conviction.

In delivering the sentence, the judge said he recognizes Lake was remorseful, but he needs to look out for the safety of the community.",,ryZLM8KxhDk,4,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ryZLM8KxhDk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEiCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDFQgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AQ==&rs=AOn4CLDyXdpfyxb9iZtuykB2pHufDO7EyQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZLM8KxhDk,Judge sentences driver for second serious crash caused while under the influence,LOCAL 12,161,4268483,cEisEuRkQqk,02/08/2023 12:24,"['Building', 'Leg']",[],24,18,16,2,1,1,1,3,1520

a7-i2zpT2_Q,2019-07-30T00:13:20Z,Nonprofits & Activism,"Hi everyone,
Thank you for all the heart warming comments regarding our proposal video. Thanks to our great video production teacher Mr. Flores and Class of 2019 student Johnny Rogel from Buena Park High School we have a more professional video with better angles than the original one. 
Hope you guys like it just like you did with the original :)

We never thought we'd have so many viewers and comments on our video, it's been awesome!!
We've been asked to do a follow up interview by some people on Married Life so we'd like to hear from you :)

What would you like to ask us? It could be about Married life, how we met, our proposal, our wedding. Anything you want as long as it's clean and proper :)

Erin and Freddie spent Christmas 2013 in beautiful Colorado with the Braun clan. Little did Erin know, Freddie was smuggling a VERY special present through the airport with him. Erin looks back on the day and laughs, understanding now why Freddie was so tense going through airport security.

Freddie schemed the proposal perfectly, and sincerely surprised not only Erin, but the rest of the witnesses as well. Both the Braun and Hutch kids get an ornament every year for Christmas, so when it came time for Erin to open hers from the Braun's, she thought she knew exactly what she was unwrapping. It was a beautiful hand-decorated glass ornament... with the engagement ring hanging in the middle of it. 

Eventually, she did see the ring and say YES. It was the happiest moment of their lives - so far! We're so happy the big moment was captured so candidly (thanks Max).

Guard plays with a kid [HQ]
corporal pours water in to the mouth of the Queen's Guard #toweroflondon
Surprise: 5 Year Old Fan Meet Queens Guard
Four-year-old boy salutes next to guardsman at Windsor Castle

Hello boys and girls and welcome to a new video. Today I will be showing you times the queens guard showed an act of kindness. As you may know, the guards must stay in a strict character whilst on their shift. They must not be distracted whilst guarding their post. However, sometimes, there are justified times they must break character. Usually, they do this when something bad is happening, but today I thought I would show you some positive clips where they show a great act of kindness whilst on duty, I promise that you will love every clip in this video so be sure to watch till the very end. If you enjoy this video at any moment, be sure to comment, like and share to friends and family.
This video comes all the way over from Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden. Straight away you see a Swedish royal guard outside the royal castle. After a few moments, a small kid walks in the view of the camera. He is holding an umbrella and wearing a hat. Basically, he is trying to imitate the guard Infront of him. He walks up to the guard, brings his umbrella to his side of his body and starts marching up and down. You can tell he is really loving the situation. After a while the guard joins in with the boy and they march in synchronization. It is such a great video, and I guarantee it made the boys day!
This next video shows a king‚Äôs guard protecting his area at the tower of London. If you did not know, the kings guard are not able to drink or go to the toilet whilst on duty. They must get on with the shift without leaving their post. There are sometimes exceptions, in this instance it was a hot summers day and they need to hydrate. This is where the corporal comes over and helps the guard drink water. A great show of kindness.
This is a brilliant video and I am sure you will absolutely love it. This is recorded by Buckingham Palace; a little kid is dressed in a full king‚Äôs guard outfit. He looks so cool. There is a guard and a police officer talking in the distance, whilst this is happening, the kid is saluting the guard. All of a sudden, the guard walks out of Buckingham palace and visits the young boy, starts shacking his hand and takes a photo with him. I am pretty sure this is against protocol, nevertheless it is a classic video and the kid must be so happy by this moment.
I am sure you have seen this video before; it is a goldmine of a video. Scott the boy in this video was celebrating his birthday, so decided to dress up in the king‚Äôs guard outfit and visit the guards at the tower of London. Soon after, a group of kings guards are marching towards a building, I assume they have finished the shift. They march past him as he salutes to them all. One decides to go back to the kid, tells him to walk over, they stand side-by-side as his mother takes a photo with them together.

xaXCh0mu84E,2023-05-20T12:00:08Z,People & Blogs,"In the tapestry of life, there are few moments as precious and heartwarming as when grandparents meet their grandchild for the very first time. Their reactions vary from the dramatic to the tender, showcasing a range of emotions that speak volumes about the extraordinary bond that is about to unfold.

In a heartwarming moment, the family gathers, creating a surprise for their beloved granddad. As he meets his newborn grandchild, tears of joy stream down his face, capturing the profound emotions of love and connection. In this cherished reunion, the power of family and the beauty of new beginnings come together, creating memories that will last a lifetime

Grandparents meet their grandchild and think, 'Wow, our hearts are full!' But wait, there's more! Their sneaky son unveils the surprise‚Äîa hidden twin grandchild! Cue the double take, the jaw drop, and the hilarious speechless moment.

Imagine their joy, after months of quarantine, when the dream finally comes true. Grandparents meet their grandchild for the very first time, and hearts instantly melt. It's a moment filled with love, laughter, and the realization that dreams really do come true.

Despite health challenges, Granddad sprints up the stairs to meet his long-awaited grandchild. Love knows no bounds, and he's determined to embrace the joy that awaits.

Unbeknownst to the grandparents, their daughter planned a surprise visit, bringing along their grandchild. As the door swung open, their jaws dropped in astonishment and delight. Tears of joy flowed freely as they held their grandchild for the very first time, creating a cherished memory they never expected.

Across the miles, separated by distance and quarantine restrictions, the grandparents yearned to meet their 3-year-old grandchild. Finally, the day arrived when travel became possible. As they embraced, their hearts swelled with love and excitement, creating an instant bond that transcended the time they had missed.

In a hilarious twist, the mischievous baby decided to take matters into their own tiny hands. Crawling with determination, they made their way to their grandparents' doorstep, leaving their parents in disbelief. When the door swung open, laughter erupted as the surprised grandparents found themselves face-to-face with their adventurous grandbaby, who had orchestrated the most adorable surprise visit.

As the grandchild dashed through the garden, her pigtails bouncing with each step, she carried a secret mission in her little heart: to surprise her beloved grandparents.When that little whirlwind of energy bolts towards their eagerly awaiting grandparents, it's like witnessing a superhero sprint to their secret lair. The excitement is contagious, and the bond that forms in that very moment becomes the stuff of legends. 


As our heartwarming journey concludes, let's celebrate the incredible influence grandparents have on their grandchildren. From sharing wisdom and traditions to showering love and support, they play an irreplaceable role in shaping their grandkids' lives. So, let's treasure these special moments, for the bond between grandparents and grandchildren is a lifelong source of joy and inspiration.

The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA's) Division I, with its football teams competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation. The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an ""access bowl"", the successors to the BCS. 

Founded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.

The Hotel Inspector meets 49-year-old Andrew Brown, who took over the derelict 15-bedroom hotel, The New Lyngarth, in 2009. But after splashing out ¬£250,000 on renovations, his Blackpool establishment is still very much down in the dumps. Andrew has grand plans for his seaside hotel.

And when water drips on Alex's head during breakfast, the full extent of the hotel's problems begins to unfold. The award-winning hotelier hopes to turn things around by bringing the hotel up to the scratch and getting The New Lyngarth an accreditation from Visit England.

tFZkd1d9NrM,2023-08-02T20:09:47Z,Pets & Animals,"Dramatic footage captures the moment a cow fell from a lorry into busy traffic on the M6.

The animal dropped onto the inside lane of the road at around 10am on Tuesday 1 August.

It can be seen skidding towards oncoming traffic, forcing drivers to take evasive action.

Police say another cow also broke free two miles away, and the motorway was closed for around 90 minutes between junctions seven and 10.

The cows were left injured according to the Central Motorway Police Group.

Kevin Rogers witnesses the bizarre incident unfold in front of him.

‚ÄúThe cow fell out the bottom of the lorry,"" he said.

‚ÄúI was the first car coming head-on to it and I managed to miss it.""

EM_zlYRMY2M,2023-08-02T13:21:23Z,News & Politics,"Pope Francis is in Portugal to mark World Youth Day, a Vatican-endorsed international festival.

It‚Äôs the pontiff‚Äôs first foreign trip since having surgery in June and is the biggest event staged by the Catholic Church.

The Pope has been attending a welcome ceremony and meeting the Portuguese president and other diplomats.

It's likely that this visit may be overshadowed by a recent official report detailing the sexual abuse of nearly 5,000 children by Portuguese clergy, mainly priests, over a 70-year period.

Boyce's exact words were, ""The ruling is I am going to deny the motion and will permit her as a designated representative to provide a statement in support of sentencing.""

Jordan‚Äôs brave escape to report her parents ensured the lives of her siblings were saved, while parents Louise and David Turpin were sentenced to life in prison.

According to the Washoe County Regional Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office they identified a total 192 deaths by suicide in 2019 ‚Äì six of which were minors 17-years-old and younger. In 2020 ‚Äì there were 183 suicides throughout the region ‚Äì two were minors.

Newly released video shows the arrest of a man and his transgender lover after the pair allegedly kidnapped a woman. Authorities say they were planning to take her to a cave and brainwash her into marrying one of them. When police found her back in January, she was chained down by the neck in the back of a minivan in New Mexico. The woman was rescued less than 24 hours after witnesses saw the her being dragged out of her Las Vegas, Nevada apartment. After receiving an alert, police pulled over the van and arrested her ex-boyfriend, and his new lover.

Police then found the kidnapped woman in the car and unchained her. ‚ÄúHe dragged me out of the place, and I fought so (bleep) hard cause I was like, this is how you die,‚Äù she said. In a federal criminal complaint, investigators say the suspects planned the kidnapping for more than a year. Throughout the arrest, One of the suspect was singing the words to the hymn ‚ÄúAmazing Grace,‚Äù asked for his bibles, and made some mental notes. ‚ÄúNote to self‚Ä¶ Wear shoes next time,‚Äù Suspect said. Both Suspects face charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment, and conspiracy.

V84v2isX3go,2023-08-03T22:16:38Z,News & Politics,"Donald Trump has claimed that his arraignment in Washington DC was a ""persecution"" shortly after leaving court.

Mr Trump falsely claimed ""When you look at what is happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent, this was never supposed to happen in America,"" from the steps of his private plane.

The Department of Justice has repeatedly stated that its criminal investigation is independent of the White House and the political apparatus of the government.

The former president then went on to claim that he has a ""substantial"" lead in both the Republican primary and against Joe Biden.

He also falsely stated: ""This is the persecution of the person that is leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. If you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him, you can't let this happen in America.""

The first New York Times poll of the 2024 election cycle shows a dead heat between President Biden and Donald Trump

A recent poll from FiveThirtyEight has Mr Trump ahead of his rival Ron DeSantis in the GOP primary.

His comments come a day after Donald Trump, former president, was indicted for his attempts to overturn the election results.

Mr Trump faces four charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States, and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, with a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison. He was due to appear in court on Thursday in Washington, either in person or by video link.

The march fell on the 63rd anniversary of Niger's independence from France. Demonstrators gathered around Independence Square in Niamey where they chanted anti-France and anti-western slogans. 
 
Tensions have been simmering between Niger's ruling junta and its neighbours in the Ecowas bloc, as calls to restore the ousted president, Mohamed Bazoum, face resistance in Niger. Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani, head of the new government rejected sanctions, warning against interference in Niger's internal affairs. 'The National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland rejects all sanctions and refuses to yield to any threat, wherever it may come from,' said Tchiani on Wednesday during a televised address.

JJeXK2vZhVo,2023-08-03T16:30:03Z,News & Politics,"Fighters from Russia's private Wagner mercenary force are being moved close to NATO's eastern flank to destabilize the military alliance, Poland's prime minister said on Thursday (August 3).

Wagner soldiers have begun training with the Belarus national army, prompting Poland to start moving more than 1,000 troops closer to the border. On Tuesday it accused Belarus of violating its airspace with military helicopters.

""We have to be aware that the number of these provocations will increase,"" Mateusz Morawiecki said after meeting Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda in eastern Poland.

""This is what the operational activities on their side are about. In order to destabilise. In order to create unrest, chaos, uncertainty,"" he added.

The politicians met in the Suwalki Gap, a sparsely populated but strategically important area of Polish territory between Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad that joins the Baltic states to other NATO members.

Nauseda said the number of Wagner fighters in Belarus could be higher than 4,000.

Belarus allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to use its territory as a launch pad for the Ukraine invasion, but has not committed its own troops to the war.

I'm using mostly Dollar Tree supplies for each wreath diy and all 6 will make a beautiful accent to your winter home decor. One of my favorites is the Santa Gnome Wreath and I used a recycled fabric curtain along with the Dollar Tree supplies and I also love my Christmas Pine Cone Wreath because I used pine cones from my own yard.  I hope you enjoy watching me make them and even try to diy one or two of them yourself.

Sometimes life gets in the way and things like yard work and gardening can fall to the bottom of the priority list. Luckily, the two of us were ready for a challenge! We spent a few days completely uprooting the chaos and making space for the plants in our yard to flourish. We were able to salvage some scrap wood and use the plants around our own yard to save money and make some big changes with a small budget. Not only do we love being outdoors, we have big dreams of growing our own food someday and were able to get a small taste of that with this project. We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre here for the adventure!

The Most Popular Fixer Upper Paint Colors!

Joanna painted the main living areas of her own farmhouse Alabaster and she continually uses it in homes she designs on Fixer Upper as well. It‚Äôs a great color to use on walls and trim both.

This gorgeous muted gray/green is Joanna‚Äôs go to color for interior walls in many of the homes she‚Äôs filmed on Fixer Upper. It is a lovely neutral when paired with white trim and her signature hardwood floors.

Joanna loves to use this color on built-ins that need a little more contrast and it makes for a fantastic color for bedrooms and baths as well.

I hope this roundup of the most popular Fixer Upper paint colors has been helpful! I really think you can‚Äôt go wrong with any of these. Just remember to get some samples up in your space before jumping in to start painting! 

I may or may not know this from experience, but husbands do not like you changing your mind after they‚Äôve already painted half the room.",,Jr_gdfP34EI,2,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jr_gdfP34EI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwE8CKgBEF5IWvKriqkDLwgBFQAAAAAYASUAAMhCPQCAokN4AfABAfgB_gmAAtAFigIMCAAQARhlIGUoZTAP&rs=AOn4CLBXbPMiSOhcH5H7LKIQ5QSLlBaGqw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr_gdfP34EI,17 Painting Tricks of All Time | Home Decorating Ideas | Joanna Gaines New House,Home,962,953776,0DHnmOKJJgU,04/08/2023 09:32,[],['.'],87,82,87,2,1,1,1,2,364

One fantastic coastal decor idea is to incorporate natural materials like driftwood, seashells, and rattan furniture, which add a touch of authenticity to the coastal theme.

Do your homework and unstained the chemical well BEFORE you use it.  Sodium hydroxide can be very dangerous! 

Yes, after cleaning a wooden deck with sodium hydroxide, it's a fine idea to treat it all with oxalic acid to brighten the wood.  I illustrate that here: https://youtu.be/ycRlpkWVLTE

This video here is a basic HOW TO... sort of like ""Deck Cleaning 102.""  As any professional exterior cleaner or deck restorer knows, *much* more can be said and done about cleaning a wood deck, but I hope this video answers the most basic questions.

VIDEO NOTES
Joe introduces today's sitewalk: a front porch epoxy. We see a Preferred employee grinding down the porch surface to provide a clean slate for the polyaspartic coating to be applied to. Joe talks about the main issues the client was facing. Their porch had cracked in multiple spots, and lacked the curb appeal the home owner desired. Joe introduces the solution to this problem. A beige polyaspartic coating will be used on the cement, with greyscale  coloured flakes to match the brick surrounding the front entrance. Polyaspartic coatings have UV protection and will protect the cement underneath from cracking, wear, and stains. We see joe spread and roll the polyaspartic coating onto the porch. He then proceeds to toss the flakes to cover the porch. After 2 hours, they scrape off and collect the excess flakes. Then, they apply a clear coat to the flakes to cure over 24 hours. The next day, Joe comes back to check how the job turned out. We see before and after photos. Joe does his outro and leaves.

VIDEO NOTES
Joe introduces today's sitewalk: applying epoxy to his grandparents' porch! He shows that the porch has damage to the concrete and is in need of a new coating. Joe explains that the most important things to do for this job are to repair the concrete, and to make sure the porch is slip resistant and safe to use. He says that porch epoxy is perfect for the type of client who knows exactly what they want because of the amount of styles epoxy can come in. 

Joe and Evan get to work on applying the first coat of epoxy, as well as the flakes. You see Evan applying epoxy to the side of the porch using a paint brush, while Joe uses a roller to do the main application to the porch and steps. Joe then begins to toss flakes all over the epoxy. All of this is done within a time limit of 40 minutes. The epoxy must cure for 8-12 hours. So Joe and Evan leave the site and will come back the next day to continue.

Joe and Evan come back the next day to continue the porch epoxy. Joe scrapes away excess flakes to create a flat, even surface. Evan cleans up extra flakes using a special vacuum. Joe mixes in Silica sand with the clear epoxy to make it slip resistant. This is important for clients who are elderly to ensure their epoxy surfaces are safe.

We watch Joe and Evan apply the clear coat of epoxy mixed with silica sand in a similar fashion as the first oat application. They leave and await the final results on the final day. The difference in before ad after is shown, and you can see for yourself, that this porch has been transformed to look incredible, is safer to use, and is now protected by epoxy from future wear and tear.

My company, Dependable Concrete LLC,  was hired to replace this damaged and unsafe walkway with a new concrete walkway, and in this short video I will demonstrate to you step by step  how I completed this job. 

After demoing the concrete we replace the vent water or gas covers. 
These vents were missing covers and were clogged with soil and trash. 

For the right fit, i prefer using a 4‚Äù flex hose

For durability,  I prefer using air entrained 4000psi concrete integrated with fiber mesh 

It‚Äôs important to protect the plumbing covers from the wet concrete

To level the walkway,  I screed the concrete using  a long 2x4 straight edge 

For jointing, I prefer to snap a chalk line as a guide to guarantee a straight line when installing A long joint

At the first stage of finishing the concrete I apply our joint lines using  a bull-float jointer along with a 2x4 as a guide for straight joint lines .

Once the concrete is poured, I begin the process of removing the protect wrapping and setting the vent covers flush with the concrete.

After the concrete has dried enough to prevent deep impressions, , I begin the second stage of finishing.  Which includes applying tools for jointing, troweling and edging. 


At the final stage of finishing the I begin texturing the concrete with a broom finish.

With a finisher ahead troweling the concrete,  another finisher is behind applying the broom finish.
   

Concrete dries very quickly so it's important to be efficient
A broom finish is the ideal finish to prevent slip and falls. A broom finish also provides an even and uniformed look to the concrete. 


The more time you allow the concrete to dry the less aggressive will be brush marks from the bristles

For driveways and inclines, you would broom sooner for an aggressive finish  

Its important to prepare the surface for a broom finish, the surface must be free of holes or trowel marks, the broom will not completely remove these marks.  For a professional looking job, straight broom lines  should be the final look. 

We fine tune the plumbing caps the sit flush with the concrete.  

When brooming concrete, the bristles collect cement, therefore, it's important to continuously clean the bristles with water. A broom loaded with cement leaves trails of cement when pulling the broom across the surface.

Clean bristles will give the job a clean and professional finish.

I have an exterior door frame that water damage has rotted the wood framing and I will show you how to repair it for under $150. A new exterior door to replace this one would cost upwards of $400 plus installation costs could be as much as double the door cost. That is also assuming you could get an installer or contractor to show up. I will show you how to repair it yourself and save money.

I called Evolution and they said:

After Thoughts about the Video: 4914 pavers/19,000lbs approx 1100sqft.  This took me 4 weeks working 50-60hrs/week with the majority of the work being prep dirt work. So roughly 200man hours by myself to do everything.  I ended up using 200 bags of sand(45-50lbs each/9000lbs) to do everything and getting them for free saved a fair amount. It did take 7 loads in the little VW pickup carrying nearly 3/4ton of sand at a time.

Slo0q_vj67c,2022-04-20T13:51:31Z,Entertainment,"many of you may have questioned why I have slowed down on making videos and its for a collection of reasons like large life changes and spreading myself thin but this without a doubt played a big part in it. I feel like this event should have been no big deal as it is very natural but it was the event that pushed me over the edge. I have been depressed for months and while I embrace moments in my life where i become depressed because i know that i will grow stronger as a person because of it, its also a reason big reason for me to be silent and reflect on life and what is going on around me. A very big part of this channel is the voice over and if I am not in the right mental space just expect me to back away when needed. I feel that is for the greater good. Healing is an ugly process and I don't want to say anything that will create a negative seed in someone else's life. 

All that said the last few months have been such an awesome thing for me and have allowed me to start breaking out of my BS. I was able to giveaway a brand new mower away in Louisville KY and then spent 2 weeks working (something that I love to do) everyday doing power washing in Arkansas from there I came home and lawns were starting to wake up so I got to cut some grass....something I love to do. lol then I got a call from my friend Al in Florida and he asked me to come down and cut some properties with him so I took the family down to Florida for a week. I knocked out a bunch of work then spent a few day at the beach with my wife and daughter jumping waves in the Ocean. On top of all of that we found out that Rachel is pregnant and we are expecting out second child. We are super excited for our new addition to the family in November. 

Thank you so much for you kindess, love and support!!

Why repair? (1) Prevent possible injury from tripping, (2) stop the continued sinking and cracking of the concrete pads, and (3) improve the look of the driveway.

In this video I'm going to show you how to form, pour and stamp a concrete patio slab.

This is a backyard concrete patio that will look like Ashlar Slate when we are done stamping the concrete.

First, I show you how to build the forms for the slab. This includes measuring the lengths, screwing them together, squaring the forms and staking them in place. 

I'm also using my Topcon HL5-B self leveling laser level to set the forms to grade/ This is the easiest laser level to use for this kind of work in my opinion.

Second, I show you how to pour the concrete for the patio slab. We spread out the concrete, mag float our edges and screed it level off the tops of the forms. Then I bull float the concrete to smoothen the surface and prepare it for stamping.

Third, I show you how to stamp the concrete using my Ashlar slate stamps. These stamps go together kinda like a puzzle, they have to go in a specific direction and inter-connect or the pattern will not come out right.

Forth, I show you how I saw cut expansion joints and power wash the concrete to prepare it for sealing.

Fifth, I show you what concrete sealer I like  to use on my stamped concrete jobs and how to apply it.

Common Tools / Materials for finishing concrete:
This info is provided from wagnermeters.com

Mixers:
Whether you‚Äôre mixing in a truck, a portable mixer or a wheelbarrow, you want to be sure your concrete is thoroughly mixed for maximum strength and durability.

Wheelbarrows
Ideal for transporting (or even mixing) small batches of concrete or tools on the job site.

Rubber Boots or Work Boots
Concrete is stiff stuff, and wearing waterproof boots is the best way to get through it and prevent contact with your skin. It‚Äôs also easy to rinse your footwear after the concrete is down.

Compactors
If the site of the concrete slab is to be prepped with a sub-base of any type, a compactor helps settle the stone or aggregate into position.

Levels
Both the sub-base and slab surface must be level. A standard long-line level, or a laser level, will let you verify that the slab is completely according to spec before pouring and after.

Tape Measures
Concrete forms and slab depth need the same ‚Äúmeasure twice, pour once‚Äù verification as any other material on the job site. 

Saws
Reciprocating saws, circular saws or grinders can be necessary to cut rebar or forms on the job site. They can also be necessary if a problem develops under the slab and a portion of the concrete has to be removed after it has set and dried.

Shovels
Shovels help distribute concrete around the job site to fill in gaps left during the pouring process or for smaller applications. Square-ended shovels generally work better for concrete; rounded ones spread concrete unevenly.

Rakes and Come-Along Rakes
Using a rake is the quickest way to begin getting the freshly-poured concrete spread more uniformly into place. Garden rakes work but concrete rakes, also called come-along rakes, have a more scooped blade for more easily pre-leveling new concrete. Concrete rakes also have a tine on the back of the blade to help lift rebar or mesh into position before the concrete begins to harden.

Vibrators
Concrete vibrators help release trapped air pockets and excess water from the concrete mix to prevent possibly compromising problems in medium to high slump concrete.

Screeds
Screeds come in a variety of sizes and can be a specific tool (also called straight edges or bump cutters), or can be simple flat pieces of dimensional lumber. The purpose of a screed is to smooth concrete after it has been moved into place by scraping away any excess from the slab surface.

Bull Floats
Bull floats are wide-bladed tools on a long (possibly telescoping handle) that provide the first pass for leveling ridges and filling voids in the concrete after the screed work has been done.

Magnesium Floats
Magnesium floats (or mag floats) are smaller handheld floats typically used to float slab edges or to use for finish work on smaller slabs.
Kneeling Boards
For hand troweling work especially, kneeling boards provide a smooth way to support your weight on the wet concrete while moving easily along the slab surface.

Leveling Concrete Trowels
Trowels also help smooth concrete surfaces for their finish coats before being left to dry. Hand-troweling is common for smaller slabs, or power trowels are often preferred for large slabs. There are varying types of trowels for specific concrete work.

Float Blades and Troweling Blades
A variety of blade types is available for floats and power trowels, each designed to accomplish different finishes. Some care must be taken during the troweling stage not to burnish the surface and prolong drying time.

Groove Cutter/Jointer Tool
For certain job types, grooving the surface also helps prevent cracking or excess damage from shrinkage as the concrete dries or during use.

Edger
An edger is a tool designed to round exposed concrete edges for a smooth finish.

Rubber Boots or Work Boots
Concrete is stiff stuff, and wearing waterproof boots is the best way to get through it and prevent contact with your skin. It‚Äôs also easy to rinse your footwear after the concrete is down.

Gloves
Many concrete mixes contain potentially caustic admixtures that can cause serious burns from extended contact with bare skin. Gloves prevent overexposure to these components (and save a few occasional blisters, too).

Safety Glasses
Standard on most job sites, wearing safety glasses is an important safety measure when drilling, grinding, power troweling or sawing concrete.

Compactors
If the site of the concrete slab is to be prepped with a sub-base of any type, a compactor helps settle the stone or aggregate into position.

Levels
Both the sub-base and slab surface must be level. A standard long-line level, or a laser level, will let you verify that the slab is completely according to spec before pouring and after.

Tape Measures
Concrete forms and slab depth need the same ‚Äúmeasure twice, pour once‚Äù verification as any other material on the job site. They are also useful for testing placement and mapping.

Moisture Retarders Moisture Barrier
Moisture or vapor retarders are used to prevent water vapor from intruding on a finished concrete slab. They are generally placed directly under on grade or below grade slabs.

Saws
Reciprocating saws, circular saws or grinders can be necessary to cut rebar or forms on the job site. They can also be necessary if a problem develops under the slab and a portion of the concrete has to be removed after it has set and dried.

The homeowner, Jim Weymouth, formed up this concrete slab and did a great job. The forms were square, straight, staked in place, and set to grade with perfection.
It's rare a homeowner can form a concrete slab this good. We form most the slabs we pour, but occasionally the owner will get the slab ready and we'll just come to pour and finish the concrete.
When Jim forms up a slab, we know from past experience, the slab will be ready to go with nothing for us to adjust or change.

I love to use a combination of items from Dollar Tree, Hobby Lobby, JoAnns, and other craft stores. But if I can think of an alternative that is at Dollar Tree I always try to let you know, even if that isn't what I use. I prefer to use items from all stores that bring you inspiration so you can make items according to your creativity. In creativity, there is NO WRONG!!! Have an amazing day.

I am SOOOOO excited to share my first-ever collaboration with the one and only, Letitia Kiu! We challenged each other to take TRASH and DIY them into beautiful home decor pieces. This is a great way to reuse, upcycle, and recycle materials you already have at home! I created DIY molds with old takeout food containers and empty plastic bottles to create concrete planters and reused toilet paper rolls into papier mache bowls. I LOVE how each of these projects came out and hope you are inspired to take items that would end up in the trash and DIY them into something!

I am challenging myself to shop for only secondhand items for an upcoming bedroom makeover so I headed over to Illinois's LARGEST thrift store to find pieces to thrift flip. Thrift &amp; Dollar has over 25,000 sq ft of unique, vintage and antique finds. From furniture, to decor, to glassware, this store had literally everything. I gave these little nightstands a big makeover and creates a huge piece of artwork, using scrap materials and supplies I already had. These projects were SO budget friendly‚Äìcan you believe I only spent $36 on both these nightstands and $0 on materials?!

Thank you for joining me today for my first Thrift with me and haul for Christmas decor in July video. Since Christmas is my favourite time of the year I can not pass up beautiful unique holiday decor, it just calls my name. I have been collecting these holiday items well before Christmas last year and had to share with you.

So I'm taking you along with me on my many thrifting adventures shopping for Christmas decor and then sharing a huge thrift haul where you will also find some styling ideas. 

Please consider subscribing and sharing with your friends, I would love it if you would join my growing YouTube family. 

Hope you enjoy and feel inspired to start thrifting for your Christmas season.

Thank you for watching.

Today we are finally sharing our DIY SMALL BATHROOM MAKEOVER on a BUDGET ... it took us a while to finally revamp our lime green bathroom, but we did it &amp; it was so worth the wait! (links from this video are below) This diy bathroom remodel took us about 5 days total &amp; we ended up loving the mix of traditional &amp; modern design style. We painted the lime green walls to something more neutral, added a hand painted stencil, board &amp; batten, replaced all the builder grade hardware, painted the bathroom vanity, added some diy wooden shelves &amp; so much more, to create a gorgeous new bathroom!  I hope this room makeover &amp; bathroom remodel video gives you lots inspiration &amp; left feeling excited to tackle your own project - As well as a friend to hang out with!

Even came back in the evening when it was dark being very aggressive and intimidating. 

When I was called by Larain, I quoted and got the job.. I then saw the patch.. heard the story I knew I was going to do it for free! What a lovely surprise for two lovely people.

Hey y'all!!!! Welcome to this weeks video!

In this video I will be finishing up part 2 of my small half bathroom makeover. I'll be showing you how I DIY'd my small half bathroom for a complete transformation for a fraction of the cost quoted to me by contractors. This bathroom went from old and outdated to a beautiful, spa-like, clean space. Come along and decorate with me as I get this bathroom together. I hope that this video will provide you with some motivation and inspiration to complete a project around your house too.

**For reference the bathroom is 3ftx6ft.**

Thanks for watching!!

Jake Bunger had been sent to Afghanistan late last year and was set to miss the entirety of the Lady Rascals of Locust Grove 6u softball season, which his daughters Taya and Liberty play for.

But after hearing the news, coach Matt Still decided to try and get the final season game pushed back by one week ‚Äì allowing devoted dad Jake to see his girl‚Äôs in action.

‚ÄúI'm here today to surprise my mom,‚Äù Andy¬†Bleil, a specialist with the¬†935th¬†ASB out of¬†Springfield,¬†said. ‚ÄúI just came home from being overseas so¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†going to see my mom today.¬†I‚Äôm pretty happy about it.""¬†

Bleil¬†was stationed in Kuwait with the Army. He says he‚Äôs been gone a year, total, and it‚Äôs been a long time since he‚Äôs seen his mom in person.¬†¬†

The plan to surprise his mom, Mary Beth Gunter, was to have her come to work thinking she‚Äôd be picking out some fabrics for the bank she works at.¬†¬†

That‚Äôs where¬†Bleil¬†would be waiting for her.¬†¬†

""We wanted to surprise her,‚Äù¬†Bleil¬†said. ‚ÄúCatch her off guard.""¬†

The rest of the family was also there awaiting Gunter‚Äôs arrival.¬†¬†¬†

""She's going¬†to¬†freak out.,‚Äù said¬†Bleil. ‚ÄúMight be a couple of tears.""¬†

Gunter walked through double doors to find¬†Bleil¬†standing there in uniform. Tears were streaming down her face.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHi Momma,‚Äù¬†Bleil¬†said. ""Happy Mother's Day...I love you.""¬†

Gunter says this was the best Mother‚Äôs Day.¬†

""I'm overwhelmed...completely overwhelmed,‚Äù said Gunter.¬†‚ÄúThis totally surprised me. I had no idea that he was going to be home. I was expecting him next week.¬†

‚ÄúYou just made the best Mother's Day ever¬†ever¬†ever¬†ever¬†ever.‚Äù¬†

Bleil¬†says he‚Äôll be home for a while now.¬†¬†

""Obviously,¬†I've missed all my people, my friends and family, home-cooked meals - that's been a big thing, indoor plumbing,""¬†said¬†Bleil.¬†

Gunter says she‚Äôs just happy he‚Äôs home safe.¬†¬†

""I just want him to eat and relax and hang out with his friends and just be close by,‚Äù Gunter said. ‚ÄúYou don't realize how much you miss somebody until they're¬†gone,¬†and you can't see them.¬†

‚ÄúI feel for all the moms out there who don't have their kids home this Mother's Day. I have such respect for military families.""¬†
