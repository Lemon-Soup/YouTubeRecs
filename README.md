# YouTubeRecs

A repository to share data and social network analysis on recommendations made to simulated profiles of 13-year-old YouTube users over the course of 8 days. This research was conducted over 5 weeks as one part of my MSc Thesis project into the performativity of Recommender Systems on YouTube. Not included here: data collection, cleansing and exploratory analysis which was written in python.

Three tables of replication data and a Network Analysis script are included:

- 'edgelist_engaged.csv' : An edgelist of recommended videos to the 'engaged' user profile.
- 'edgelist_unengaged.csv' : An edgelist of recommended videos to the 'unengaged' user profile.
- 'video_info.csv' : A table of attributes associated with the collected videos.
- 'networkAnalysis.Rmd': An R markdown file containing a script to create and analyse networks of recommended content.
- 'Network Graphs': A folder of graphs showing different projections of the networks of recommended videos.
